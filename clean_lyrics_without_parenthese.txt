>>>The 1 Taylor Swift
<sos>
I'm doing good, I'm on some new shit
Been saying "yes" instead of "no"
I thought I saw you at the bus stop, I didn't though
I hit the ground running each night
I hit the Sunday matinée
You know the greatest films of all time were never made
I guess you never know, never know
And if you wanted me, you really should've showed
And if you never bleed, you're never gonna grow
And it's alright now
But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
I have this dream you're doing cool shit
Having adventures on your own
You meet some woman on the internet and take her home
We never painted by the numbers, baby
But we were making it count
You know the greatest loves of all time are over now
I guess you never know, never know
And it's another day waking up alone
But we were something, don't you think so?
Roaring twenties, tossing pennies in the pool
And if my wishes came true
It would've been you
In my defense, I have none
For never leaving well enough alone
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
I, I, I persist and resist the temptation to ask you
If one thing had been different
Would everything be different today?
We were something, don't you think so?
Rosé flowing with your chosen family
And it would've been sweet
If it could've been me
In my defense, I have none
For digging up the grave another time
But it would've been fun
If you would've been the one
>>>The Alcott Taylor Swift
<sos>
I get myself twisted in threads
To meet you at The Alcott
I'd go to the corner in the back
Where you'd always be
And there you are, sittin' as usual
With your golden notebook
Writin' something about someone
Who used to be me
And the last thing you wanted
Is the first thing I do
I tell you my problems
You tell me the truth
It's the last thing you wanted
It's the first thing I do
I tell you that I think I'm fallin'
Back in love with you
I sit there silently
Waitin' for you to look up 
I see you smile
When you see it's me
I had to do something
To break into your golden thinking 
How many times will I do this
And you'll still believe? 
It's the last thing you wanted
It's the first thing you do
You tell me your problems
And I tell you the truth
It's the last thing you wanted
It's the first thing I do
I tell you that I think I'm fallin'
Back in love with you
And I'll ruin it all over
I'll ruin it for you
I'll ruin it all over
And over like I always do
I'll ruin it all over
I'll ruin it for you
I'll ruin it all over
And over like I always do
It's the last thing I wanted
It's the first thing I do
I tell you my problems
And you tell me the truth
It's the last thing I wanted
It's the first thing I do
I tell you that I think I'm fallin'
Back in love 
Back in love with you
Back in love with you
<eos>
>>>All of the Girls You Loved Before Taylor Swift
<sos>
When you think of all the late nights
Lame fights over the phone
Wake up in the mornin' with someone
A heart is drawn around your name
In someone's handwriting, not mine
Sneakin' out into town
Your past and mine are parallel lines
Stars all aligned and they intertwined
The way you call me "baby"
Treat me like a lady
All that I can say is
All of the girls you loved before 
Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street led you straight to me
Now you're all I need, I'm so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before
But I love you more
When I think of all the makeup
Fake love out on the town 
Cryin' in the bathroom for some dude
Whose name I cannot remember now
Secret jokes all alone
No one's home, sixteen and wild 
Breakin' up, makin' up
Leave without sayin' goodbye 
And just know that
It's everything that made me
Now I call you "baby"
It's why you're so amazing
All of the girls you loved before 
Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street led you straight to me
Now you're all I need, I'm so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before
But I love you more
Your mother brought you up loyal and kind
Teenage love taught you there's good in goodbye
Every woman that you knew brought you here
I wanna teach you how forever feels
Like the girls you loved before 
Made you the one I've fallen for
Every dead-end street  led you straight to me 
Now you're all I need , I'm so thankful for
All of the girls you loved before
But I love you more
<eos>
>>>All Too Well Taylor Swift
<sos>
I walked through the door with you, the air was cold
But something 'bout it felt like home somehow
And I left my scarf there at your sister's house
And you've still got it in your drawer, even now
Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze
We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate
Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place
And I can picture it after all these days
And I know it's long gone and
That magic's not here no more
And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all
'Cause there we are again on that little town street
You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me
Wind in my hair, I was there
I remember it all too well
Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red
You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed
And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team
You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me
And I know it's long gone and
There was nothing else I could do
And I forget about you long enough
To forget why I needed to
'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night
We're dancing ‘round the kitchen in the refrigerator light
Down the stairs, I was there
I remember it all too well, yeah
Well, maybe we got lost in translation
Maybe I asked for too much
But maybe this thing was a masterpiece
'Til you tore it all up
Running scared, I was there
I remember it all too well
And you call me up again
Just to break me like a promise
So casually cruel in the name of being honest
I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here
'Cause I remember it all, all, all
Time won't fly, it's like I'm paralyzed by it
I'd like to be my old self again, but I'm still trying to find it
After plaid shirt days and nights when you made me your own
Now, you mail back my things and I walk home alone
But you keep my old scarf from that very first week
'Cause it reminds you of innocence and it smells like me
You can't get rid of it
'Cause you remember it all too well, yeah
'Cause there we are again when I loved you so
Back before you lost the one real thing you've ever known
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
Wind in my hair, you were there
You remember it all
Down the stairs, you were there
You remember it all
It was rare, I was there
I remember it all too well
<eos>
>>>Anti-Hero Taylor Swift
<sos>
I have this thing where I get older, but just never wiser
Midnights become my afternoons
When my depression works the graveyard shift, all of the people
I've ghosted stand there in the room
I should not be left to my own devices
They come with prices and vices
I end up in crisis
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
'Cause you got tired of my scheming
I'm the problem, it's me
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
Sometimes, I feel like everybody is a sexy baby
And I'm a monster on the hill
Too big to hang out, slowly lurching toward your favorite city
Pierced through the heart, but never killed
Did you hear my covert narcissism I disguise as altruism
Like some kind of congressman?
I wake up screaming from dreaming
One day, I'll watch as you're leaving
And life will lose all its meaning
I'm the problem, it's me 
At teatime, everybody agrees
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
I have this dream my daughter-in-law kills me for the money
She thinks I left them in the will
The family gathers 'round and reads it and then someone screams out
"She's laughing up at us from Hell"
I'm the problem, it's me
Everybody agrees, everybody agrees
It's me, hi 
I'm the problem, it's me 
At teatime , everybody agrees 
I'll stare directly at the sun, but never in the mirror
It must be exhausting always rooting for the anti-hero
<eos>
>>>The Archer Taylor Swift
<sos>
Combat, I'm ready for combat
I say I don't want that, but what if I do?
'Cause cruelty wins in the movies
I've got a hundred thrown-out speeches I almost said to you
Easy they come, easy they go
I jump from the train, I ride off alone
I never grew up, it's getting so old
Help me hold on to you
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
Dark side, I search for your dark side
But what if I'm alright, right, right, right here?
And I cut off my nose just to spite my face
Then I hate my reflection for years and years
I wake in the night, I pace like a ghost
The room is on fire, invisible smoke
And all of my heroes die all alone
Help me hold on to you
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Screaming, who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
'Cause they see right through me
They see right through me
They see right through
Can you see right through me?
They see right through
They see right through me
I see right through me
All the king's horses, all the king's men
Couldn't put me together again
'Cause all of my enemies started out friends
Help me hold on to you
I've been the archer, I've been the prey
Who could ever leave me, darling
But who could stay?
Combat, I'm ready for combat
<eos>
>>>August Taylor Swift
<sos>
Salt air, and the rust on your door
I never needed anything more
Whispers of "Are you sure?"
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine
Your back beneath the sun
Wishin' I could write my name on it
Will you call when you're back at school?
I remember thinkin' I had you
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine
Back when we were still changin' for the better
For me, it was enough
To live for the hope of it all
Cancel plans just in case you'd call
And say, "Meet me behind the mall"
So much for summer love and saying "us"
'Cause you weren't mine to lose
You weren't mine to lose, no
But I can see us lost in the memory
August slipped away into a moment in time
'Cause it was never mine
And I can see us twisted in bedsheets
August sipped away like a bottle of wine
'Cause you were never mine
But do you remember?
Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
"Meet me behind the mall"
Remember when I pulled up and said "Get in the car"
And then canceled my plans just in case you'd call?
Back when I was livin' for the hope of it all 
For the hope of it all, for the hope of it all
<eos>
>>>Babe Taylor Swift
<sos>
Didn't wanna be the one that got away, yeah
Big mistake, broke the sweetest promise
That you never should have made
I'm here on the kitchen floor
You call, but I won't hear it
You said "No one else"
How could you do this, babe?
You really blew this, babe
We ain't gettin' through this one, babe
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe
This is the last time, this is the last time
This is the last time, I'll ever call you "babe"
Takin' down the pictures and the plans we made, yeah
And it's strange how your face doesn't look so innocent
Your secret has its consequence and that's on you, babe
I break down every time you call
We're a wreck, you're the wreckin' ball
We said, "No one else"
How could you do this, babe?
You really blew this, babe
We ain't gettin' through this one, babe
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe
This is the last time, this is the last time
This is the last time
Since you admitted it , I keep picturin' 
Her lips on your neck , I can't unsee it 
I hate that because of you , I can't love you, babe
What a shame, didn't want to be the one that got away
How could you do this, babe?
You really blew this, babe
We ain't gettin' through this one, babe
How could you do this, babe?
This is the last time, this is the last time
This is the last time I'll ever call you, babe
How could you do this, babe?
I'm here on the kitchen floor, you call but I won't hear it
You said "No one else," we ain't gettin' through this one, babe
I break down every time you call, this is the last time
We're a wreck, you're the wreckin' ball
This is the last time
You said "No one else"
This is the last time I'll ever call you "babe"

>>>Back to December Taylor Swift
<sos>
I'm so glad you made time to see me
How's life? Tell me, how's your family?
I haven't seen them in a while
You've been good, busier than ever
We small talk, work and the weather
Your guard is up and I know why
Because the last time you saw me
Is still burned in the back of your mind
You gave me roses and I left them there to die
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you sayin', "I'm sorry for that night"
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December all the time
These days, I haven't been sleeping
Stayin' up, playing back myself leavin'
When your birthday passed and I didn't call
Then I think about summer, all the beautiful times
I watched you laughing from the passenger side
And realized I loved you in the fall
And then the cold came, the dark days
When fear crept into my mind
You gave me all your love and all I gave you was goodbye
So this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you, sayin', "I'm sorry for that night"
And I go back to December all the time
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time
I miss your tanned skin, your sweet smile
So good to me, so right
And how you held me in your arms that September night
The first time you ever saw me cry
Maybe this is wishful thinkin'
But if we loved again, I swear I'd love you right
I'd go back in time and change it, but I can't
So, if the chain is on your door, I understand
But this is me swallowing my pride
Standin' in front of you, sayin', "I'm sorry for that night"
And I go back to December
It turns out freedom ain't nothing but missin' you
Wishin' I'd realized what I had when you were mine
I go back to December, turn around and make it alright
I go back to December, turn around and change my own mind
I go back to December all the time

'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Did you have to do this?
I was thinking that you could be trusted
Did you have to ruin what was shiny?
Now it's all rusted
Did you have to hit me where I'm weak?
Baby, I couldn't breathe
And rub it in so deep
Salt in the wound like you're laughing right at me
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Did you think we'd be fine?
Still got scars on my back from your knives
So don't think it's in the past
These kinds of wounds, they last and they last
Now, did you think it all through?
All these things will catch up to you
And time can heal, but this won't
So if you're coming my way
Oh, it's so sad to
Think about the good times
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood
You know it used to be mad love
So take a look what you've done
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Now we've got problems
And I don't think we can solve 'em
You made a really deep cut
And baby, now we've got bad blood, hey!
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
Band-aids don't fix bullet holes
You say sorry just for show
If you live like that, you live with ghosts
If you love like that, blood runs cold
'Cause baby, now we've got bad blood

>>>Beautiful Ghosts Taylor Swift
<sos>
Follow me home if you dare to
I wouldn't know where to lead you
Should I take chances when no one took chances on me?
So I watch from the dark, wait for my life to start
With no beauty in my memory
All that I wanted was to be wanted
Too young to wander London streets, alone and haunted
At least you have something, something to cling to
Visions of dazzling rooms I'll never get let into
And the memories were lost long ago
But at least you have beautiful ghosts
Perilous night, their voices calling
A flicker of light before the dawning
Out here, the wild ones are taming the fear within me
Scared to call them my friends and be broken again
Is this hope just a mystical dream?
All that I wanted was to be wanted
Too young to wander London streets, alone and haunted
At least you have something, something to cling to
Visions of dazzling rooms I'll never get let into
And the memories were lost long ago
But at least you have beautiful ghosts
And so maybe my home isn't what I had known
What I thought it would be
But I feel so alive with these phantoms of night
And I know that this life isn't safe, but it's wild and it's free
All that I wanted was to be wanted
I'll never wander London streets, alone and haunted
With them, I have something, something to cling to
I never knew I'd love this world they've let me into
And the memories were lost long ago
So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts
And the memories were lost long ago
So I'll dance with these beautiful ghosts
<eos>
>>>Begin Again Taylor Swift
<sos>
Took a deep breath in the mirror
He didn't like it when I wore high heels
Turn the lock and put my headphones on
He always said he didn't get this song
But I do, I do
I walked in, expecting you'd be late
But you got here early and you stand and wave
I walk to you
You pull my chair out and help me in
And you don't know how nice that is
And you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday, in a café, I watched it begin again
You said you never met one girl who
Had as many James Taylor records as you
We tell stories and you don't know why
I'm comin' off a little shy
But you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday, in a café, I watched it begin again
And we walked down the block to my car
And I almost brought him up
But you start to talk about the movies
That your family watches every single Christmas
And I wanna talk about that
And for the first time, what's past is past
'Cause you throw your head back laughin' like a little kid
I think it's strange that you think I'm funny 'cause he never did
I've been spending the last eight months
Thinkin' all love ever does is break and burn and end
But on a Wednesday, in a café, I watched it begin again
But on a Wednesday, in a café, I watched it begin again

>>>Bejeweled Taylor Swift
<sos>
Baby love, I think I've been a little too kind
Didn't notice you walkin' all over my peace of mind
In the shoes I gave you as a present
Puttin' someone first only works when you're in their top five
And by the way, I'm goin' out tonight
Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask, "Do you have a man?"
I could still say, "I don't remember"
Don't put mе in the basement
Whеn I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real, I polish up real nice
Baby boy, I think I've been too good of a girl 
Did all the extra credit, then got graded on a curve
I think it's time to teach some lessons
I made you my world , have you heard? 
I can reclaim the land
And I miss you , but I miss sparklin' 
Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer
And when I meet the band
They ask, "Do you have a man?"
I could still say, "I don't remember"
Don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real, I polish up real nice
Sapphire tears on my face
Sadness became my whole sky
But some guy said my aura's moonstone
Just 'cause he was high
And we're dancin' all night
And you can try to change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
What's a girl gonna do?
A diamond's gotta shine
Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer 
And when I meet the band
They ask, "Do you have a man?"
I could still say, "I don't remember"
Don't put me in the basement
When I want the penthouse of your heart
Diamonds in my eyes
I polish up real , I polish up real nice
And we're dancin' all night
And you can try to change my mind
But you might have to wait in line
What's a girl gonna do? What's a girl gonna do?
I polish up nice
Best believe I'm still bejeweled
When I walk in the room
I can still make the whole place shimmer

>>>The Best Day Taylor Swift
<sos>
I'm five years old, it's getting cold, I've got my big coat on
I hear your laugh and look up smiling at you, I run and run
Past the pumpkin patch and the tractor rides
Look now, the sky is gold
I hug your legs and fall asleep on the way home
I don't know why all the trees change in the fall
But I know you're not scared of anything at all
Don't know if Snow White's house is near or far away
But I know I had the best day with you today
And don't know how my friends could be so mean
I come home crying and you hold me tight and grab the keys
And we drive and drive until we found a town far enough away
And we talk and window shop 'til I've forgotten all their names
I don't know who I'm going to talk to now at school
But I know I'm laughing on the car ride home with you
Don't know how long it's going to take to feel okay
But I know I had the best day with you today
I have an excellent father, his strength is making me stronger
God smiles on my little brother, inside and out
He's better than I am
I grew up in a pretty house and I had space to run
And I had the best days with you
There is a video I found from back when I was three
You set up a paint set in the kitchen and you're talking to me
It's the age of princesses and pirate ships and the seven dwarfs
And you're the prettiest lady in the whole wide world
And now, I know why all the trees change in the fall
I know you were on my side even when I was wrong
And I love you for giving me your eyes
For staying back and watching me shine
And I didn't know if you knew, so I'm taking this chance to say
That I had the best day with you today
<eos>
>>>Better Man Taylor Swift
<sos>
I know I’m probably better off on my own
Than lovin' a man who didn’t know
What he had when he had it
And I see the permanent damage you did to me
Never again, I just wish I could forget when it was magic
I wish it wasn’t 4am, standing in the mirror
Saying to myself, you know you had to do it
I know the bravest thing I ever did was run
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
And I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
I know I’m probably better off all alone
Than needing a man who could change his mind
At any given minute
And it was always on your terms
I waited on every careless word
Hoping it might turn sweet again
Like it was in the beginning
But your jealousy, oh, I can hear it now
You’re talking down to me like I'll always be around
You push my love away like it was some kind of loaded gun
Oh, you never thought I’d run
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
And I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
I hold onto this pride because these days it’s all I have
And I gave to you my best and we both know you can't say that
I wish you were a better man
I wonder what we would’ve become
If you were a better man
We might still be in love
If you were a better man
You would've been the one
If you were a better man
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
Sometimes, in the middle of the night, I can feel you again
But I just miss you, and I just wish you were a better man
I know why we had to say goodbye
Like the back of my hand
But I just miss you and I just wish you were a better man
We might still be in love, if you were a better man
You would've been the one
If you were a better man

>>>Better than Revenge Taylor Swift
<sos>
Now, go stand in the corner and think about what you did 
Haha, time for a little revenge
The story starts when it was hot and it was summer and
I had it all, I had him right there where I wanted him
She came along, got him alone, and let's hear the applause
She took him faster than you can say "Sabotage"
I never saw it coming, wouldn't have suspected it
I underestimated just who I was dealing with
She had to know the pain was beating on me like a drum
She underestimated just who she was stealing from
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, woah
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha
She looks at life like it's a party and she's on the list
She looks at me like I'm a trend and she's so over it
I think her ever-present frown is a little troubling and
She thinks I'm psycho 'cause I like to rhyme her name with things
But sophistication isn't what you wear or who you know
Or pushing people down to get you where you wanna go
Oh, they didn't teach you that in prep school so it's up to me
But no amount of vintage dresses gives you dignity
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, woah
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge, ha
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but haven't you heard?
I'm just another thing for you to roll your eyes at, honey
You might have him, but I always get the last word
She's not a saint and she's not what you think
She's an actress, woah 
She's better known for the things that she does
On the mattress, woah
Soon, she's gonna find stealing other people's toys
On the playground won't make you many friends
She should keep in mind, she should keep in mind
There is nothing I do better than revenge
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing?
'Cause I don't think you do, oh 
Do you still feel like you know what you're doing? 
I don't think you do, I don't think you do
Let's hear the applause 
Come on, show me how much better you are
See, you deserve some applause
'Cause you're so much better
She took him faster than you could say "Sabotage"

>>>Betty Taylor Swift

Betty, I won't make assumptions
About why you switched your homeroom, but
I think it's 'cause of me
Betty, one time I was riding on my skateboard
When I passed your house
It's like I couldn't breathe
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you
Betty, I know where it all went wrong
Your favorite song was playing
From the far side of the gym
I was nowhere to be found
I hate the crowds, you know that
Plus, I saw you dance with him
You heard the rumors from Inez
You can't believe a word she says
Most times, but this time it was true
The worst thing that I ever did
Was what I did to you
But if I just showed up at your party
Would you have me? Would you want me?
Would you tell me to go fuck myself
Or lead me to the garden?
In the garden, would you trust me
If I told you it was just a summer thing?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you
I was walking home on broken cobblestones
Just thinking of you when she pulled up like
A figment of my worst intentions
She said "James, get in, let's drive"
Those days turned into nights
Slept next to her, but
I dreamt of you all summer long
Betty, I'm here on your doorstep
And I planned it out for weeks now
But it's finally sinkin' in
Betty, right now is the last time
I can dream about what happens when
You see my face again
The only thing I wanna do
Is make it up to you
So I showed up at your party
Yeah, I showed up at your party
Will you have me? Will you love me?
Will you kiss me on the porch
In front of all your stupid friends?
If you kiss me, will it be just like I dreamed it?
Will it patch your broken wings?
I'm only seventeen, I don't know anything
But I know I miss you
Standing in your cardigan
Kissin' in my car again
Stopped at a streetlight
You know I miss you

>>>Bigger Than the Whole Sky Taylor Swift
<sos>
No words appear before me in the aftermath
Salt streams out my eyes and into my ears
Every single thing I touch becomes sick with sadness
'Cause it's all over now, all out to sea
You were bigger than the whole sky
You were more than just a short time
And I've got a lot to pine about
I've got a lot to live without
I'm never gonna meet
What could've been, would've been
What should've been you
What could've been, would've been you
Did some bird flap its wings ovеr in Asia?
Did some force take you bеcause I didn't pray?
Every single thing to come has turned into ashes
'Cause it's all over, it's not meant to be
So I'll say words I don't believe
You were bigger than the whole sky
You were more than just a short time
And I've got a lot to pine about
I've got a lot to live without
I'm never gonna meet
What could've been, would've been
What should've been you
What could've been, would've been you
What could've been, would've been
What should've been you
What could've been, would've been you
You were bigger than the whole sky
You were more than just a short time
And I've got a lot to pine about
I've got a lot to live without
I'm never gonna meet
What could've been, would've been

>>>Blank Space Taylor Swift
<sos>
Nice to meet you, where you been?
I could show you incredible things
Magic, madness, heaven, sin
Saw you there and I thought
"Oh, my God, look at that face
You look like my next mistake
Love's a game, wanna play?" Ayy
New money, suit and tie
I can read you like a magazine
Ain't it funny? Rumors fly
And I know you heard about me
So, hey, let's be friends
I'm dying to see how this one ends
Grab your passport and my hand
I can make the bad guys good for a weekend
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless, mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
Cherry lips, crystal skies
I could show you incredible things
Stolen kisses, pretty lies
You're the king, baby, I'm your queen
Find out what you want
Be that girl for a month
Wait, the worst is yet to come, oh, no
Screaming, crying, perfect storms
I can make all the tables turn
Rose garden filled with thorns
Keep you second guessing, like
"Oh, my God, who is she?"
I get drunk on jealousy
But you'll come back each time you leave
'Cause, darling, I'm a nightmare dressed like a daydream
So it's gonna be forever
Or it's gonna go down in flames?
You can tell me when it's over, mm
If the high was worth the pain
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane
'Cause you know I love the players
And you love the game
'Cause we're young and we're reckless 
We'll take this way too far
It'll leave you breathless , mm
Or with a nasty scar
Got a long list of ex-lovers
They'll tell you I'm insane 
But I've got a blank space, baby
And I'll write your name
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya
Boys only want love if it's torture
Don't say I didn't, say I didn't warn ya

>>>Both of Us Taylor Swift
<sos>
I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us
Ever thought about losing it
When your money’s all gone and you lose your whip
You might lose your grip when the landlord tell you that you due for rent
And the grass so green on the other side
Make a nigga wanna run straight through the fence
Open up the fridge 'bout 20 times
But you still can’t find no food in it
And sometimes I wonder, why we care so much about the way we look
And the way we talk and the way we act and the clothes we bought
How much that cost?
Does it even really matter?
'Cause if life is a uphill battle
But y’all tryna climb with the same ol’ ladder
In the same boat, with the same ol’ paddle
Why so shallow? I’m just askin'
What’s the pattern to the madness?
Everybody ain’t a number one draft pick
Most of us ain’t Hollywood actors
But if it’s all for one, and one for all
Then maybe one day, we all could ball
Do it one time for the underdogs
Sincerely yours, from one of y'all
I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us
I could feel your pain, I could feel your struggle
You just wanna live, but everything's so low
That you could drown in a puddle
That’s why I gotta hold us up, yeah, hold us up
For all the times no one’s ever spoke for us
To every single time that they play this song
You can say that that’s what Bobby Ray wrote for us
When the tides get too high
And the sea up underneath gets so deep
And you feel like you’re just another person
Getting lost in the crowd, way up high in the nosebleeds
Uh, because we've both been there, both of us
But we still stand tall with our shoulders up
And even though we always against the odds
These are the things that’ve molded us
And if life hadn’t chosen us
Sometimes I wonder where I would've wound up
'Cause if it was up to me, I’d make a new blueprint
Then build it from the ground up, hey
But if it’s all for one, and one for all
Then maybe one day, we all could ball
Do it one time for the underdogs
From Bobby Ray, to all of y’all
I wish I was strong enough to lift not one but both of us
Some day I will be strong enough to lift not one but both of us

>>>Breathe Taylor Swift

I see your face in my mind as I drive away
'Cause none of us thought it was gonna end that way
People are people and sometimes, we change our minds
But it's killing me to see you go after all this time
Music starts playing like the end of a sad movie
It's the kind of ending you don't really wanna see
'Cause it's tragedy and it'll only bring you down
Now, I don't know what to be without you around
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand
And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to
Never wanted this, never wanna see you hurt
Every little bump in the road, I tried to swerve
But people are people and sometimes, it doesn't work out
Nothing we say is gonna save us from the fall out
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me
You're the only thing I know like the back of my hand
And I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you but I have to
It's 2 A.M, feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know it's not easy, easy for me
It's 2 A.M, feeling like I just lost a friend
Hope you know this ain't easy, easy for me
And we know it's never simple, never easy
Never a clean break, no one here to save me, oh-oh
I can't breathe without you, but I have to
Breathe without you, but I have to

My castle crumbled overnight
I brought a knife to a gunfight
They took the crown, but it's alright
All the liars are calling me one
Nobody's heard from me for months
I'm doin' better than I ever was
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walkin' with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
All my flowers grew back as thorns
Windows boarded up after the storm
He built a fire just to keep me warm
All the drama queens taking swings
All the jokers dressing up as kings
They fade to nothing when I look at him
And I know I make the same mistakes every time
Bridges burn, I never learn
At least I did one thing right
I did one thing right
I'm laughing with my lover, makin' forts under covers
Trust him like a brother
Yeah, you know I did one thing right
Starry eyes sparkin' up my darkest night
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walkin' with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream
High above the whole scene
Loves me like I'm brand new
So call it what you want, yeah
Call it what you want to
I want to wear his initial on a chain 'round my neck
Chain 'round my neck
Not because he owns me
But 'cause he really knows me
Which is more than they can say, I
I recall late November
Holding my breath, slowly, I said
"You don't need to save me
But would you run away with me?"
Yes 
My baby's fit like a daydream
Walkin' with his head down
I'm the one he's walking to
So call it what you want, yeah 
Call it what you want to
My baby's fly like a jet stream

Loves me like I'm brand new

Vintage tee, brand new phone
High heels on cobblestones
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
But I knew you
Dancin' in your Levi's
Drunk under a streetlight, I
Hand under my sweatshirt
Baby, kiss it better, I
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
You put me on and said I was your favorite
A friend to all is a friend to none
Chase two girls, lose the one
When you are young, they assume you know nothing
But I knew you
Giving me your weekends, I
Your heartbeat on the High Line
Once in twenty lifetimes, I
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
You put me on and said I was your favorite
To kiss in cars and downtown bars
Was all we needed
You drew stars around my scars
But now I'm bleedin'
'Cause I knew you
Steppin' on the last train
Marked me like a bloodstain, I
Tried to change the ending
Peter losing Wendy, I
Leavin' like a father
Running like water, I
And when you are young, they assume you know nothing
But I knew you'd linger like a tattoo kiss
I knew you'd haunt all of my what-ifs
The smell of smoke would hang around this long
'Cause I knew everything when I was young
I knew I'd curse you for the longest time
Chasin' shadows in the grocery line
I knew you'd miss me once the thrill expired
And you'd be standin' in my front porch light
And I knew you'd come back to me
You'd come back to me
And you'd come back to me
And you'd come back
And when I felt like I was an old cardigan
You put me on and said I was your favorite

Lonesome I'll always stay

Free as these birds, light as whispers
No, they never did see me here
And she's in my dreams
Into the mist, into the clouds
I make a fist, I'll make it count
And there are places I will never, ever go
And things that only Carolina will ever know
Carolina stains on the dress she left
Indelible scars, pivotal marks
Blue as the life she fled
Carolina pines, won't you cover me?
Hide me like robes down the back road
Muddy these webs we weave
And you didn't see me here
Oh, they never did see me
And she's in my dreams
Into the mist, into the clouds

And there are places I will never, ever go

I was held up so high, I used to be great
They used to cheer when they saw my face
Now, I fear I have fallen from grace
And I feel like my castle's crumbling down
And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground
And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down
You don't wanna know me now
Once, I was the great hope for a dynasty
Crowds would hang on my words and they trusted me
Their faith was strong, but I pushed it too far
I held that grudge 'til it tore me apart
Power went to my head and I couldn't stop
Ones I loved tried to help, so I ran them off
And here I sit alone behind walls of regret
Falling down like promises that I never kept
And I feel like my castle's crumbling down
And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground
And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down
You don't wanna know me now
My foes and friends watch my reign end
I don't know how it could've ended this way
Smoke billows from my ships in the harbor
People look at me like I'm a monster
Now they're screamin' at the palace front gates
Used to chant my name
Now they're screaming that they hate me
Never wanted you to hate me
My castle's crumbling down
And I watch all my bridges burn to the ground
And you don't want to know me, I will just let you down 
My castle's crumbling down
You don't wanna know me now, now

Tonight, we stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But we'll stand up champions tonight
It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down

You told your family for a reason
You couldn't keep it in
Your sister splashed out on the bottle
Now no one's celebrating
Dom Pérignon, you brought it
No crowd of friends applauded
Your hometown skeptics called it
You had a speech, you're speechless
Love slipped beyond your reaches
And I couldn't give a reason
Your Midas touch on the Chevy door
November flush and your flannel cure
"This dorm was once a madhouse"
I made a joke, "Well, it's made for me"
How evergreen, our group of friends
Don't think we'll say that word again
And soon they'll have the nerve to deck the halls
That we once walked through
One for the money, two for the show
I never was ready so I watch you go
Sometimes you just don't know the answer
'Til someone's on their knees and asks you
"She would've made such a lovely bride
What a shame she's fucked in the head," they said
But you'll find the real thing instead
She'll patch up your tapestry that I shred
And hold your hand while dancing
Never leave you standing
Crestfallen on the landing
Your mom's ring in your pocket
Her picture in your wallet
You won't remember all my
And it's a sad picture, the final blow hits you
Somebody else gets what you wanted again and
You know it's all the same, another time and place
Repeating history and you're getting sick of it
But I believe in whatever you do
And I'll do anything to see it through
Because these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
So we've been outnumbered, raided, and now, cornered
It's hard to fight when the fight ain’t fair
We're getting stronger now, find things they never found
They might be bigger but we're faster and never scared
You can walk away, say we don't need this
But there's something in your eyes says we can beat this
'Cause these things will change
Can you feel it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back will fall down
This revolution, the time will come
For us to finally win
And we'll sing hallelujah, we'll sing hallelujah
Tonight, we stand, get off our knees
Fight for what we've worked for all these years
And the battle was long, it's the fight of our lives
But we'll stand up champions tonight
It was the night things changed
Can you see it now?
These walls that they put up to hold us back fell down
It's a revolution, throw your hands up
'Cause we never gave in
And we'll sing hallelujah, we sang hallelujah
My winter nights are taken up by static
Stress and holiday shopping traffic
But I close my eyes and I'm somewhere else
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
Where the people would come
To dance under sparkling lights
Bundled up in their mittens and coats
And the cider would flow
And I just wanna be there tonight
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
And everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me, "I love you"
Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true
In my heart is a Christmas tree farm
There's a light in the barn
We run inside out from the cold
In the town, kids are dreamin' of sleighs
And they're warm and they're safe
They wake to see a blanket of snow
Sweet dreams of holly and ribbon
And everythin' is icy and blue
And you would be there too
Watchin' the fire glow
And tellin' me, "I love you"
Just bein' in your arms
Takes me back to that little farm
Where every wish comes true
And when I'm feelin' alone
You remind me of home
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
And when the world isn't fair
I pretend that we're there
Baby, baby, Merry Christmas 
Under the mistletoe 
Watching the fire glow
And tellin' me, "I love you"
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas 
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas 
Oh, baby, baby, Merry Christmas
Where every wish comes true
>>>Coney Island Taylor Swift
<sos>
Break my soul in two looking for you
But you're right here
If I can't relate to you anymore
Then who am I related to?
And if this is the long haul
How'd we get here so soon?
Did I close my fist around something delicate?
Did I shatter you?
And I'm sitting on a bench in Coney Island
Wondering where did my baby go?
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down
The question pounds my head
What's a lifetime of achievement
If I pushed you to the edge?
But you were too polite to leave me
And do you miss the rogue
Who coaxed you into paradise and left you there?
Will you forgive my soul
When you're too wise to trust me and too old to care?
'Cause we were like the mall before the internet
It was the one place to be
The mischief, the gift-wrapped suburban dreams
Sorry for not winning you an arcade ring
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down
Were you waiting at our old spot
In the tree line
By the gold clock
Did I leave you hanging every single day?
Were you standing in the hallway
With a big cake, happy birthday
Did I paint your bluest skies the darkest grey?
And when I got into the accident
The sight that flashed before me was your face
But when I walked up to the podium, I think that I forgot to say your name
I'm on a bench in Coney Island
Wondering where did my baby go?
The fast times, the bright lights, the merry go
Sorry for not making you my centerfold
Lost again with no surprises
Disappointments, close your eyes
And it gets colder and colder
When the sun goes down
The sight that flashed before me was your face
When the sun goes down
But I think that I forgot to say your name
Sorry for not making you my, making you my
Making you my centerfold

>>>Cornelia Street Taylor Swift
<sos>
We were in the backseat
Drunk on something stronger than the drinks in the bar
"I rent a place on Cornelia Street"
I say casually in the car
We were a fresh page on the desk
Filling in the blanks as we go
As if the street lights pointed in an arrow head
And I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
Windows flung right open, autumn air
Jacket 'round my shoulders is yours
We bless the rains on Cornelia Street
Memorize the creaks in the floor
Back when we were card sharks, playing games
I thought you were leading me on
I packed my bags, left Cornelia Street
Before you even knew I was gone
But then you called, showed your hand
I turned around before I hit the tunnel
Sat on the roof, you and I
I hope I never lose you, hope it never ends
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
That's the kinda heartbreak time could never mend
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name 
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
You hold my hand on the street
Walk me back to that apartment
Years ago, we were just inside
Barefoot in the kitchen
That became my religion, listen
I hope I never lose you
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
And baby, I get mystified by how this city screams your name 
And baby, I'm so terrified of if you ever walk away
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I don't wanna lose you 
I'd never walk Cornelia Street again
I don't wanna lose you 
"I rent a place on Cornelia Street"
I say casually in the car

I'd never gone with the wind, just let it flow
Let it take me where it wants to go
'Til you open the door, there's so much more
I'd never seen it before
I was tryin' to fly but I couldn't find wings
But you came along and you changed everything
You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm fallin' and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier
I've watched from a distance as you made life your own
Every sky was your own kind of blue
And I wanted to know how that would feel
And you made it so real
You showed me somethin' that I couldn't see
You opened my eyes
And you made me believe
You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm fallin' and I am lost in your eyes
You make me crazier, crazier, crazier, oh
Baby, you showed me what livin' is for
I don't wanna hide anymore
You lift my feet off the ground
You spin me around
You make me crazier, crazier
Feels like I'm fallin' and I am lost in your eyes

Fever dream high in the quiet of the night
You know that I caught it 
Bad, bad boy, shiny toy with a price
You know that I bought it 
Killing me slow, out the window
I'm always waiting for you to be waiting below
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
What doesn't kill me makes me want you more
And it's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
It's a cruel summer with you
Hang your head low in the glow of the vending machine
I'm not dying 
We say that we'll just screw it up in these trying times
We're not trying 
So cut the headlights, summer's a knife
I'm always waiting for you just to cut to the bone
Devils roll the dice, angels roll their eyes
And if I bleed, you'll be the last to know, oh
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
It's a cruel summer with you
I'm drunk in the back of the car
And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar 
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate 
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"
He looks up, grinnin' like a devil
It's new, the shape of your body
It's blue, the feeling I've got
And it's ooh, woah-oh
It's a cruel summer
It's cool, that's what I tell 'em
No rules in breakable heaven
It's a cruel summer with you

And I cried like a baby comin' home from the bar 
Said, "I'm fine," but it wasn't true
I don't wanna keep secrets just to keep you
And I snuck in through the garden gate
Every night that summer just to seal my fate 
And I scream, "For whatever it's worth
I love you, ain't that the worst thing you ever heard?"

>>>Dear John Taylor Swift
<sos>
Long were the nights when
My days once revolved around you
Praying the floor won't fall through again
And my mother accused me of losing my mind
But I swore I was fine
You paint me a blue sky
Then go back and turn it to rain
And I lived in your chess game
But you changed the rules everyday
Wondering which version of you I might get on the phone tonight
Well, I stopped pickin' up and this song is to let you know why
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Well, maybe it's me
And my blind optimism to blame
Or maybe it's you and your sick need
To give love and take it away
And you'll add my name to your long list of traitors
And I look back in regret how I ignored when they said
"Run as fast as you can"
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
Dear John, I see it all now, it was wrong
Don't you think nineteen's too young
To be played by your dark, twisted games when I loved you so?
You are an expert at sorry and keeping lines blurry
Never impressed by me acing your tests
All the girls that you've run dry have tired lifeless eyes
'Cause you burned them out
But I took your matches before fire could catch me
So don't look now
I'm shining like fireworks over your sad empty town
Dear John, I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress cried the whole way home
I see it all now that you're gone
Don't you think I was too young to be messed with?
The girl in the dress wrote you a song
Don't you think I was too young?

My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
Any promises now, can we, babe?
But you can make me a drink
Dive bar on the East Side, where you at?
Phone lights up my nightstand in the black
Come here, you can meet me in the back
Dark jeans and your Nikes, look at you
Oh, damn, never seen that color blue
Just think of the fun things we could do
 This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
 We can't make

Is it chill that you're in my head?
'Cause I know that it's delicate 
Is it cool that I said all that?
Is it too soon to do this yet?
'Cause I know that it's delicate
Isn't it? Isn't it? Isn't it?
Third floor on the West Side, me and you
Handsome, you're a mansion with a view
Do the girls back home touch you like I do?
Long night with your hands up in my hair
Echoes of your footsteps on the stairs
Stay here, honey, I don't wanna share
 This ain't for the best
My reputation's never been worse, so
You must like me for me
 We can't make
Any promises now, can we, babe?

Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
I've been breakin' hearts a long time
And toyin' with them older guys
Just playthings for me to use
Something happened for the first time
In the darkest little paradise
Shaking, pacin', I just need you
For you, I would cross the line
I would waste my time
I would lose my mind
They say, "She's gone too far this time"
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby

My name is whatever you decide
And I'm just gonna call you mine
I'm insane, but I'm your baby 
Echoes  of your name inside my mind
Halo hiding my obsession
I once was poison ivy, but now, I'm your daisy
And, baby, for you
I would  fall from grace
Just to  touch your face
If you  walk away, I'd beg you on my knees to stay
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right
Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life 
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right 
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
I get so high, oh
Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
Trip of my life, oh
Every time you're, every time you're touchin' me
Every time you're, every time you're lovin' me
Oh, Lord, save me, my drug is my baby
I'll be usin' for the rest of my life
Don't blame me, love made me crazy
If it doesn't, you ain't doin' it right

>>>Electric Touch Taylor Swift

Just breathe, just relax, it'll be okay
Just an hour 'til your car's in the driveway
Just the first time ever hangin' out with you tonight
I've got my money on things goin' badly
Got a history of stories ending sadly
Still hoping that the fire won't burn me
Just one time, just one time
All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
Got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life
And I want you now, wanna need you forever
In the heat of your electric touch, mmm
I've been left in the rain lost and pining
I'm tryin' hard not to look like I'm trying
'Cause every time I tried hard for love, it fell apart 
I've gotten used to no one callin' my phone
I've grown accustomed to sleepin' alone
Still, I know that all it takes is to get it right
Just one time, just one time
All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
Got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life
And I want you now, wanna need you forever
In the heat of your electric touch, mmm
I was thinking just one time 
Maybe the stars align 
And maybe I call you mine
And you won't need space
Or string me along while you decide
And just one time 
Maybe the moment's right 
It's 8:05 and I see two headlights
All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
Got a feelin' your electric touch 
All I know is this could either break my heart or bring it back to life
Got a feelin' your electric touch could fill this ghost town up with life 
And I want you now, wanna need you forever
In the heat of your electric touch, mmm

>>>Enchanted Taylor Swift
<sos>
There I was again tonight
Forcing laughter, faking smiles
Same old tired, lonely place
Shifting eyes and vacancy
Vanished when I saw your face
All I can say is it was enchanting to meet you
Your eyes whispered, "Have we met?"
Across the room, your silhouette
Starts to make its way to me
The playful conversation starts
Counter all your quick remarks
Like passing notes in secrecy
And it was enchanting to meet you
All I can say is I was enchanted to meet you
This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
The lingering question kept me up
2AM, who do you love?
I wonder 'til I'm wide awake
And now, I'm pacing back and forth
Wishing you were at my door
I'd open up and you would say
"Hey, it was enchanting to meet you"
All I know is I was enchanted to meet you
This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
This night is flawless, don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
This is me praying that
This was the very first page
Not where the storyline ends
My thoughts will echo your name
Until I see you again
These are the words I held back
As I was leaving too soon
I was enchanted to meet you
Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you
Please, don't be in love with someone else 
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you 
This night is sparklin', don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck, blushin' all the way home
I'll spend forever wonderin' if you knew
This night is flawless 
Don't you let it go
I'm wonderstruck 
Dancing around all alone
I'll spend forever 
Wonderin' if you knew
I was enchanted to meet you
Please, don't be in love with someone else
Please, don't have somebody waiting on you

>>>Epiphany Taylor Swift

Keep your helmet, keep your life, son
Just a flesh wound, here's your rifle
"Sir, I think he's bleeding out"
And some things you just can't speak about
With you I serve, with you I fall down, down
Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out
Something med school did not cover
Someone's daughter, someone's mother
Holds your hand through plastic now
"Doc, I think she's crashing out"
And some things you just can't speak about
Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what you've seen
With you I serve, with you I fall down, down 
Watch you breathe in, watch you breathing out, out
With you I serve , with you I fall down , down 
Watch you breathe in , watch you breathing out , out 
Only twenty minutes to sleep
But you dream of some epiphany
Just one single glimpse of relief
To make some sense of what you've seen
<eos>
>>>Everything Has Changed Taylor Swift
<sos>
All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since 18 hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind, making me feel like
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
And everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed
And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
And I'll take 'em down, take 'em down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time
Taking flight, making me feel right
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
And everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed
Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
And everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed
All I know is we said, "Hello"
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days, I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

>>>Exile Taylor Swift

I can see you standing, honey
With his arms around your body
Laughin', but the joke's not funny at all
And it took you five whole minutes
To pack us up and leave me with it
Holdin' all this love out here in the hall
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
I can see you starin', honey
Like he's just your understudy
Like you'd get your knuckles bloody for me
Second, third, and hundredth chances
Balancin' on breaking branches
Those eyes add insult to injury
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
I'm not your problem anymore
So who am I offending now?
You were my crown, now I'm in exile, seein' you out
I think I've seen this film before
So I'm leaving out the side door
So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you
We always walked a very thin line
You didn't even hear me out 
You never gave a warning sign 
I never learned to read your mind 
I couldn't turn things around 
'Cause you never gave a warning sign 
So many signs, so many signs
You didn't even see the signs
I think I've seen this film before
And I didn't like the ending
You're not my homeland anymore
So what am I defending now?
You were my town, now I'm in exile, seein' you out

So I'm leavin' out the side door
So step right out, there is no amount
Of crying I can do for you

You didn't even hear me out 
You never gave a warning sign 
I never learned to read your mind 
I couldn't turn things around 
'Cause you never gave a warning sign 
You never gave a warning sign

Even when you're sleeping
Keep your eyes open
The tricky thing is yesterday we were just children
Playing soldiers, just pretending
Dreaming dreams with happy endings
In backyards, winning battles with our wooden swords
But now we've stepped into a cruel world
Where everybody stands and keeps score
Keep your eyes open
Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your eyes open
So here you are, two steps ahead and staying on guard
Every lesson forms a new scar
They never thought you'd make it this far
But turn around 
Oh, they've surrounded you, it's a showdown 
And nobody comes to save you now
But you got something they don't
Yeah, you got something they don't
You just gotta keep your eyes open
Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your eyes open
Keep your feet ready, heartbeat steady
Keep your eyes open
Keep your aim locked, the night goes dark
Keep your eyes open
Everybody's waiting for you to break down
Everybody's watching to see the fallout
Even when you're sleeping, sleeping
Keep your eyes open
Keep your eyes open

We were crazy to think
Crazy to think that this could work
Remember how I said I'd die for you?
We were stupid to jump
In the ocean separating us
Remember how I’d fly to you?
And I can't talk to you when you're like this
Staring out the window like I’m not your favorite town
I'm New York City
I still do it for you, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you're led by blind faith, blind faith
But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We’d still worship this love
I know heaven's a thing
I go there when you touch me, honey
Hell is when I fight with you
But we can patch it up good
Make confessions and we’re begging for forgiveness
Got the wine for you
And you can't talk to me when I'm like this
Daring you to leave me just so I can try and scare you
You're the West Village
You still do it for me, babe
They all warned us about times like this
They say the road gets hard and you get lost
When you’re led by blind faith, blind faith
But we might just get away with it
Religion's in your lips
Even if it's a false god
We might just get away with it
The altar is my hips
Even if it's a false god
We'd still worship this love
We'd still worship this love, ah
Still worship this love
Even if it's a false god
Still worship this love

There's something 'bout the way
The street looks when it's just rained
There's a glow off the pavement, you walk me to the car
And you know I wanna ask you to dance right there
In the middle of the parking lot, yeah
We're driving down the road, I wonder if you know
I'm trying so hard not to get caught up now
But you're just so cool, run your hands through your hair
Absentmindedly making me want you
And I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you, I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
So, baby, drive slow 'til we run out of road
In this one horse town, I wanna stay right here
In this passenger's seat
You put your eyes on me
In this moment now, capture it, remember it
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you, I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
Well, you stood there with me in the doorway
My hands shake, I'm not usually this way but
You pull me in and I'm a little more brave
It's the first kiss, it's flawless, really something
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this
You take my hand and drag me head first, fearless
And I don't know why but with you, I'd dance
In a storm in my best dress, fearless
'Cause I don't know how it gets better than this

You take a deep breath and you walk through the doors
It's the mornin' of your very first day
You say hi to your friends you ain't seen in a while
Try and stay out of everybody's way
It's your freshman year and you're gonna be here
For the next four years in this town
Hopin' one of those senior boys will wink at you and say
"You know, I haven't seen you around before"
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, feelin' like there's nothin' to figure out
Well, count to ten, take it in
This is life before you know who you're gonna be
You sit in class next to a redhead named Abigail
And soon enough, you're best friends
Laughin' at the other girls who think they're so cool
We'll be outta here as soon as we can
And then, you're on your very first date and he's got a car
And you're feelin' like flyin'
And your mama's waitin' up and you're thinkin' he's the one
And you're dancin' 'round your room when the night ends
When the night ends
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen and your first kiss
Makes your head spin 'round
But in your life, you'll do things greater than
Dating the boy on the football team
But I didn't know it at fifteen
When all you wanted was to be wanted
Wish you could go back and tell yourself what you know now
Back then, I swore I was gonna marry him someday
But I realized some bigger dreams of mine
And Abigail gave everything she had
To a boy who changed his mind
And we both cried
'Cause when you're fifteen and somebody tells you they love you
You're gonna believe them
And when you're fifteen, don't forget to look before you fall
I've found time can heal most anything
And you just might find who you're supposed to be
I didn't know who I was supposed to be
Your very first day
Take a deep breath, girl
Take a deep breath as you walk through the doors
<eos>
>>>Forever & Always Taylor Swift

Once upon a time
I believe it was a Tuesday when I caught your eye
And we caught onto something
I hold onto the night
You looked me in the eye and told me you loved me
Were you just kidding?
'Cause it seems to me
This thing is breaking down, we almost never speak
I don't feel welcome anymore
Baby, what happened? Please, tell me
'Cause one second, it was perfect
Now, you're halfway out the door
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always"
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
Was I out of line?
Did I say something way too honest, made you run and hide
Like a scared little boy?
I looked into your eyes
Thought I knew you for a minute, now, I'm not so sure
So here's to everything coming down to nothing
Here's to silence that cuts me to the core
Where is this going?
Thought I knew for a minute, but I don't anymore
And I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when he said, "Forever and always"
Oh, and it rains in your bedroom
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
You didn't mean it, baby, I don't think so
Oh, back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
Back up, baby, back up
Did you forget everything?
'Cause it rains in your bedroom
It rains when you're here and it rains when you're gone
'Cause I was there when you said, "Forever and always"
Oh, I stare at the phone, he still hasn't called
And then you feel so low you can't feel nothing at all
And you flashback to when we said, "Forever and always"
And it rains in your bedroom

You should take it as a compliment
That I got drunk and made fun of the way you talk
You should think about the consequence
Of your magnetic field being a little too strong
And I got a boyfriend, he's older than us
He's in the club doin' I don't know what
You're so cool, it makes me hate you so much 
Whisky on ice, Sunset and Vine
You've ruined my life by not being mine
I can't say anything to your face
'Cause look at your face 
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way
But what can I say?
You should take it as a compliment
That I'm talking to everyone here but you 
And you should think about the consequence
Of you touching my hand in a darkened room 
If you've got a girlfriend, I'm jealous of her
But if you're single, that's honestly worse
'Cause you're so gorgeous it actually hurts 
Ocean blue eyes looking in mine
I feel like I might sink and drown and die
I can't say anything to your face 
'Cause look at your face 
And I'm so furious
At you for making me feel this way

You make me so happy it turns back to sad
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have
And you are so gorgeous it makes me so mad 
You make me so happy it turns back to sad 
There's nothing I hate more than what I can't have and
Guess I'll just stumble on home to my cats  alone
Unless you wanna come along 
I can't say anything to your face 
'Cause look at your face 
And I'm so furious 
At you for making me feel this way 
But what can I say?

Trying my best to understand all that your love can bring
Oh half of my heart's got a grip on the situation
Half of my heart takes time
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
That I can't keep loving you 
Oh, with half of my heart
I was made to believe I'd never love somebody else
Made a plan, stay the man who can only love himself
Lonely was the song I sang, until the day you came
Showing me another way and all that my love can bring
Oh half of my heart's got a grip on the situation
Half of my heart takes time
Half of my heart's got a right mind to tell you
That I can't keep loving you 
Oh, with half of my heart
Your faith is strong
But I can only fall short for so long
Down the road, later on
You will hate that I never gave more to you than half of my heart
But I can't stop loving you
I can't stop loving you
But I can't stop loving you with half of my
Half of my heart
Half of my heart’s got a real cool imagination
Half of my heart’s got you
Half of my heart’s got the right mind to tell you
Half of my heart won’t do
Half of my heart is a shotgun wedding to a bride with a paper ring
And half of my heart is the part of a man who's never truly loved anything
Half of my heart

I'll be the one waiting there even when it's cold
Hey, Stephen, boy, you might have me believing
I don't always have to be alone
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so

Can't help it if there's no one else

Hey, Stephen, I've been holding back this feeling
So I got some things to say to you, ha

But I never seen nobody shine the way you do
The way you walk, way you talk, way you say my name
It's beautiful, wonderful, don't you ever change
Hey, Stephen, why are people always leaving?
I think you and I should stay the same
'Cause I can't help it if you look like an angel
Can't help it if I wanna kiss you in the rain so
Come feel this magic I've been feeling since I met you
Can't help it if there's no one else
Mmm, I can't help myself
They're dimming the street lights, you're perfect for me
Why aren't you here tonight?
I'm waiting alone now, so come on and come out
And pull me near and shine, shine, shine

Why I should be the one you choose
All those other girls, well, they're beautiful
But would they write a song for you?

Can't help it if there's no one else

Yeah, I bet you're bending God's ear talking 'bout me

>>>Hits Different Taylor Swift

I washed my hands of us at the club
You made a mess of me
I pictured you with other girls in love
Then threw up on the street
Like waiting for a bus that never shows
You just start walkin' on
They say that if it's right, you know
Each bar plays our song
Nothing has ever felt so wrong
Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different this time
Movin' on was always easy for me to do
It hits different 'cause it's you
I used to switch out these Kens, I'd just ghost
Rip the band-aid off and skip town likе an asshole outlaw
Freedom felt like summеr then on the coast
Now the sun burns my heart and the sand hurts my feelings
And I never don't cry  at the bar
Yeah, my sadness is contagious 
I slur your name 'til someone puts me in a car
I stopped receiving invitations
Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different this time
Movin' on was always easy for me to do
It hits different 'cause it's you
I find the artifacts, cried over a hat
Cursed the space that I needed
I trace the evidence, make it make some sense
Why the wound is still bleedin'
You were the one that I loved
Don't need another metaphor, it's simple enough
A wrinkle in time like the crease by your eyes
This is why they shouldn't kill off the main guy
Dreams of your hair and your stare and sense of belief
In the good in the world, you once believed in me
And I felt you and I held you for a while
Bet I could still melt your world
Argumentative, antithetical dream girl
I heard your key turn in the door down the hallway
Is that your key in the door?
Is it okay? Is it you?
Or have they come to take me away?
To take me away
Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
It hits different 
It hits different this time
Movin' on was always easy for me to do
It hits different 
It hits different 'cause it's you
Oh, my, love is a lie
Shit my friends say to get me by
Movin' on was always easy for me to do
It hits different 
It hits different 'cause it's you

>>>Holy Ground Taylor Swift
<sos>
I was reminiscing just the other day
While having coffee all alone, and Lord, it took me away
Back to a first-glance feeling on New York time
Back when you fit in my poems like a perfect rhyme
Took off faster than a green light, go
Hey, you skip the conversation when you already know
I left a note on the door with a joke we'd made
And that was the first day
And darling, it was good
And right there where we stood
Spinning like a girl in a brand new dress
We had this big wide city all to ourselves
We blocked the noise with the sound of, "I need you"
And for the first time, I had something to lose
And I guess we fell apart in the usual way
And the story's got dust on every page
But sometimes, I wonder how you think about it now
And I see your face in every crowd
'Cause darling, it was good
And right there where we stood
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
And right there where we stood
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
For all that we've been through
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you
Tonight, I'm gonna dance
Like you were in this room
But I don't wanna dance
If I'm not dancing with you

>>>I Bet You Think About Me Taylor Swift
<sos>
3 AM and I'm still awake, I'll bet you're just fine
Fast asleep in your city that's better than mine
And the girl in your bed has a fine pedigree
And I'll bet your friends tell you she's better than me, huh
Well, I tried to fit in with your upper-crust circles
Yeah, they let me sit in back when we were in love
Oh, they sit around talkin' about the meaning of life
And the book that just saved 'em that I hadn't heard of
But now that we're done and it's over
I bet you couldn't believe
When you realized I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
And I bet you think about me
You grew up in a silver-spoon gated community
Glamorous, shiny, bright Beverly Hills
I was raised on a farm, no, it wasn't a mansion
Just livin' room dancin' and kitchen table bills
But you know what they say, you can't help who you fall for
And you and I fell like an early spring snow
But reality crept in, you said we're too different
You laughed at my dreams, rolled your eyes at my jokes
Do you have all the space that you need?
I don't have to be your shrink to know that you'll never be happy
And I bet you think about me
I bet you think about me, yes
I bet you think about me
Oh, block it all out
The voices so loud, sayin'
"Why did you let her go?"
Does it make you feel sad
That the love that you're lookin' for
Is the love that you had?
Now you're out in the world, searchin' for your soul
Scared not to be hip, scared to get old
Chasing make-believe status, last time you felt free
Was when none of that shit mattered 'cause you were with me
But now that we're done and it's over
I bet it's hard to believe
But it turned out I'm harder to forget than I was to leave
And, yeah, I bet you think about me
I bet you think about me, yes
I bet you think about me
I bet you think about me when you're out
At your cool indie music concerts every week
I bet you think about me in your house
With your organic shoes and your million-dollar couch
I bet you think about me when you say
"Oh my god, she's insane, she wrote a song about me"
I bet you think about me
<eos>
>>>I Don't Wanna Live Forever Taylor Swift
<sos>
Been sittin' eyes wide open
Behind these four walls, hopin' you'd call
It's just a cruel existence
Like there's no point hopin' at all
Baby, baby, I feel crazy
Up all night, all night and every day
Give me somethin', oh, but you say nothin'
What is happening to me?
I don't wanna live forever
'Cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
I'm sittin' eyes wide open
And I got one thing stuck in my mind
Wonderin' if I dodged a bullet
Or just lost the love of my life, oh
Baby, baby, I feel crazy
Up all night, all night and every day
I gave you somethin', but you gave me nothin'
What is happening to me?
I don't wanna live forever
'Cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit  wherever 
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
Baby, baby, I feel crazy
I see you around in all these empty faces
Up all night, all night and every day
I've been looking sad in all the nicest places
Give me somethin', oh, but you say nothin'
Now I'm in a cab, I tell 'em where your place is
What is happening to me?
I don't wanna live forever
'Cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit  wherever 
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home 
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home 
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home 
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home 
I just wanna keep calling your name
Until you come back home
I just wanna keep callin' your name
Until you come back home

>>>Illicit Affairs Taylor Swift
<sos>
Make sure nobody sees you leave
Hood over your head, keep your eyes down
Tell your friends you're out for a run
You’ll be flushed when you return
Take the road less traveled by
Tell yourself you can always stop
What started in beautiful rooms
Ends with meetings in parking lots
And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and longing stares
It's born from just one single glance
But it dies and it dies and it dies
A million little times
Leave the perfume on the shelf
That you picked out just for him
So you leave no trace behind
Like you don’t even exist
Take the words for what they are
A dwindling, mercurial high
A drug that only worked
The first few hundred times
And that's the thing about illicit affairs
And clandestine meetings and stolen stares
They show their truth one single time
But they lie and they lie and they lie
A million little times
And you wanna scream
Don't call me "kid," don't call me "baby"
Look at this godforsaken mess that you made me
You showed me colors you know I can't see with anyone else
Don't call me "kid," don't call me "baby"
Look at this idiotic fool that you made me
You taught me a secret language I can't speak with anyone else
And you know damn well
For you, I would ruin myself
A million little times
<eos>
>>>Innocent Taylor Swift
<sos>
I guess you really did it this time
Left yourself in your war path
Lost your balance on a tightrope
Lost your mind trying to get it back
Wasn't it easier in your lunchbox days?
Always a bigger bed to crawl into
Wasn't it beautiful when you believed in everything
And everybody believed in you?
It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
Did some things you can't speak of
But at night, you live it all again
You wouldn't be shattered on the floor now
If only you had seen what you know now then
Wasn't it easier in your firefly-catching days?
When everything out of reach
Someone bigger brought down to you
Wasn't it beautiful running wild 'til you fell asleep
Before the monsters caught up to you?
It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
Thirty-two and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent
Time turns flames to embers
You'll have new Septembers
Every one of us has messed up, too, ooh
Minds change like the weather
I hope you remember
Today is never too late to be brand new, oh
It's alright, just wait and see
Your string of lights is still bright to me, oh
Who you are is not where you've been
You're still an innocent
It's okay, life is a tough crowd
Thirty-two and still growing up now
Who you are is not what you did
You're still an innocent
Lost your balance on a tightrope, oh
It's never too late to get it back

>>>Invisible String Taylor Swift

Green was the color of the grass
Where I used to read at Centennial Park
I used to think I would meet somebody there
Teal was the color of your shirt
When you were sixteen at the yogurt shop
You used to work at to make a little money
Gave me no compasses, gave me no signs
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Tying you to me?
Bad was the blood of the song in the cab
On your first trip to LA
You ate at my favorite spot for dinner
Bold was the waitress on our three-year trip
Getting lunch down by the Lakes
She said I looked like an American singer
Cutting me open, then healing me fine
Were there clues I didn't see?
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Tying you to me?
A string that pulled me
Out of all the wrong arms, right into that dive bar
Something wrapped all of my past mistakes in barbed wire
Chains around my demons
Wool to brave the seasons
One single thread of gold
Tied me to you
Cold was the steel of my axe to grind
For the boys who broke my heart
Now I send their babies presents
Gold was the color of the leaves
When I showed you around Centennial Park
Hell was the journey but it brought me heaven
Gave me the blues and then purple-pink skies
And isn't it just so pretty to think
All along there was some
Tying you to me?

I showed you my hand and you still let me win
And who was I to say that this was meant to be?
The road that was broken brought us together
And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would give you a diamond ring
When I fold, you see the best in me
The joker and the queen
I've been played before, if you hadn't guessed
So I kept my cards close to my foolproof vest
But you called my bluff 
And saw through all my tells 
And then you went all in
And we left together
And I know you think that what makes a king
Is gold, a palace, and diamond rings
When I fold, you see the best in mе
The joker and the queen
And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hеarts that would give you a diamond ring
When I folded, you saw the best in me

>>>Karma Taylor Swift

You're talking shit for the hell of it
Addicted to betrayal, but you're relevant
You're terrified to look down
'Cause if you dare, you'll see the glare
Of everyone you burned just to get there
It's coming back around
And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn't know what I mean
'Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that
Spiderboy, king of thieves
Weave your little webs of opacity
My pennies made your crown
Trick me once, trick me twice
Don't you know that cash ain't the only price?
It's coming back around
And I keep my side of the street clean
You wouldn't know what I mean
'Cause karma is my boyfriend
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat
Purring in my lap 'cause it loves me
Flexing like a goddamn acrobat
Me and karma vibe like that
Ask me what I learned from all those years
Ask me what I earned from all those tears
Ask me why so many fade, but I'm still here
'Cause karma is the thunder
Karma's on your scent like a bounty hunter
Karma's gonna track you down
Step by step, from town to town
Sweet like justice, karma is a queen
Karma takes all my friends to the summit
Karma is the guy on the screen
Coming straight home to me
'Cause karma is my boyfriend 
Karma is a god
Karma is the breeze in my hair on the weekend 
Karma's a relaxing thought
Aren't you envious that for you it's not?
Sweet like honey, karma is a cat

"It only hurts this much right now"
Was what I was thinkin' the whole time
Breathe in, breathe through, breathe deep, breathe out
I'll be gettin' over you my whole life
You know how scared I am of elevators
Never trust it if it rises fast
Uh-oh, I'm fallin' in love
Oh no, I'm fallin' in love again
Oh, I'm fallin' in love
I thought the plane was goin' down
How'd you turn it right around?
It only feels this raw right now
Lost in the labyrinth of my mind
Break up, break free, break through, break down
You would break your back to make me break a smile
You know how much I hate
That everybody just expects me to bounce back
Uh-oh, I'm fallin' in love
Oh no, I'm fallin' in love again
Oh, I'm fallin' in love
I thought the plane was goin' down
How'd you turn it right around?
Uh-oh, I'm fallin' in love
Oh no, I'm fallin' in love again
Oh, I'm fallin' in love

Oh no, I'm fallin' in love again
Oh, I'm fallin' in love

>>>The Lakes Taylor Swift

Is it romantic how all my elegies eulogize me?
I'm not cut out for all these cynical clones
These hunters with cell phones
Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse
What should be over burrowed under my skin
In heart-stopping waves of hurt
I've come too far to watch some namedropping sleaze
Tell me what are my words worth
Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse
I want auroras and sad prose
I want to watch wisteria grow right over my bare feet
'Cause I haven't moved in years
And I want you right here
A red rose grew up out of ice frozen ground
With no one around to tweet it
While I bathe in cliffside pools
With my calamitous love and insurmountable grief
Take me to the Lakes where all the poets went to die
I don't belong and, my beloved, neither do you
Those Windermere peaks look like a perfect place to cry
I'm setting off, but not without my muse
No, not without you

>>>Last Christmas Taylor Swift

Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special
Once bitten and twice shied
I keep my distance but you still catch my eye
Do you recognize me
Well, it has been a year, it does not surprise me
Merry Christmas, I wrapped it up and sent it
With a note saying 'I love you', I meant it
Now I know what a fool I've been
But if you kiss me now, I know you would fool me again
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special
A crowded room and friends with tired eyes
I am hiding from you and your soul of ice
My God, I thought you were someone to rely on
Me, I guess I was a shoulder to cry on
A face on a lover with a fire in his heart
A girl on a cover but you tore her apart
Maybe this year I will give it to someone special
Because last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special
It won't be anything like, anything like
Last Christmas I gave you my heart
But the very next day, you gave it away
This year, to save me from tears
I will give it to someone special

>>>The Last Great American Dynasty Taylor Swift
<sos>
Rebekah rode up on the afternoon train, it was sunny
Her saltbox house on the coast took her mind off St. Louis
Bill was the heir to the Standard Oil name and money
And the town said, "How did a middle-class divorcée do it?"
The wedding was charming, if a little gauche
There's only so far new money goes
They picked out a home and called it "Holiday House"
Their parties were tasteful, if a little loud
The doctor had told him to settle down
It must have been her fault his heart gave out
"There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the maddest woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything"
Rebekah gave up on the Rhode Island set forever
Flew in all her Bitch Pack friends from the city
Filled the pool with champagne and swam with the big names
And blew through the money on the boys and the ballet
And losing on card game bets with Dalí
"There goes the last great American dynasty
Who knows, if she never showed up, what could've been
There goes the most shameless woman this town has ever seen
She had a marvelous time ruining everything"
They say she was seen on occasion
Pacing the rocks, staring out at the midnight sea
And in a feud with her neighbor
She stole his dog and dyed it key lime green
Fifty years is a long time
Holiday House sat quietly on that beach
Free of women with madness, their men and bad habits
And then it was bought by me
Who knows, if I never showed up, what could've been
There goes the loudest woman this town has ever seen
I had a marvelous time ruining everything
A marvelous time ruining everything
I had a marvelous time

Find myself at your door
Just like all those times before
I’m not sure how I got there
All roads, they lead me here
I imagine you are home
In your room, all alone
And you open your eyes into mine
And everything feels better
And right before your eyes
I'm breaking, no past
Just you and me
This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye 
You find yourself at my door
And just like all those times before
You wear your best apology
But I was there to watch you leave
And all the times I let you in
Just for you to go again
Disappear when you come back
And right before your eyes
I'm aching, run fast
Just you and me
This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye 
This is the last time you tell me I've got it wrong
This is the last time I say it's been you all along
This is the last time I let you in my door
This is the last time, I won't hurt you anymore
Oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho, oh-ho
This is the last time I'm asking you this
Put my name at the top of your list
This is the last time I'm asking you why
You break my heart in the blink of an eye
This is the last time I'm asking you this 
Put my name at the top of your list 
This is the last time I'm asking you why 
You break my heart in the blink of an eye 
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this
This is the last time I'm asking you, last time I'm asking you
Last time I'm asking you this

Staring at the ceiling with you
Oh, you don't ever say too much
And you don't really read into
I been under scrutiny 
You handle it beautifully 
All this shit is new to me 
The lavender haze creeping up on me
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
All they keep asking me 
Is if I'm gonna be your bride
The only kinda girl they see 
Is a one-night or a wife
I find it dizzying 
They're bringing up my history 
But you weren't even listening 
The lavender haze creepin' up on me
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say
The 1950s shit they want from me
I just wanna stay in that lavender haze
Talk your talk and go viral
I just need this love spiral
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk 
Talk your talk and go viral
I just need this love spiral
Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk
I feel 
The lavender haze creeping up on me
I'm damned if I do give a damn what people say

Get it off your chest
Get it off my desk
I just wanna stay

We can go drivin' in, on my scooter
Uh, you know, just 'round London 
I love my hometown as much as Motown, I love SoCal
And you know I love Springsteen, faded blue jeans, Tennessee whiskey
But somethin' happened, I heard him laughin'
I saw the dimples first and then I heard the accent
They say, "Home is where the heart is"
But that's not where mine lives
You know I love a London boy
I enjoy walkin' Camden Market in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you 
And now I love high tea, stories from Uni' and the West End
You can find me in the pub, we are watchin' rugby with his school friends
Show me a gray sky, a rainy cab ride
Babes, don't threaten me with a good time
They say, "Home is where the heart is"
But, God, I love the English
You know I love a London boy
I enjoy nights in Brixton, Shoreditch in the afternoon
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true
You know I love a London boy
Boy, I fancy you
So please show me Hackney
Doesn't have to be Louis V up on Bond Street
Just wanna be with you
Wanna be with you
Stick with me, I'm your queen
Like a Tennessee Stella McCartney on the Heath
Just wanna be with you 
Wanna be with you, oh, woah
You know I love a London boy
I enjoy walkin' Soho, drinkin' in the afternoon 
He likes my American smile, like a child when our eyes meet
Darling, I fancy you 
Took me back to Highgate, met all of his best mates
So I guess all the rumors are true 
You know I love a London boy 
Boy , I fancy you 
So please show me Hackney
Doesn't have to be Louis V up on Bond Street
Just wanna be with you

>>>Long Live Taylor Swift
<sos>
I said, "Remember this moment"
In the back of my mind
The time we stood with our shaking hands
The crowds in stands went wild
We were the kings and the queens
And they read off our names
The night you danced like you knew our lives
Would never be the same
You held your head like a hero
On a history book page
It was the end of a decade
But the start of an age
Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made"
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered
I said, "Remember this feeling"
I pass the pictures around
Of all the years that we stood there on the sidelines
Wishing for right now
We are the kings and the queens
You traded your baseball cap for a crown
When they gave us our trophies
And we held them up for our town
And the cynics were outraged
Screaming, "This is absurd"
'Cause for a moment, a band of thieves
In ripped up jeans got to rule the world
Long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made"
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
Long live all the mountains we moved
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
I was screaming, "Long live that look on your face"
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered
Hold on to spinning around
Confetti falls to the ground
May these memories break our fall
Will you take a moment? Promise me this
That you'll stand by me forever
But if, God forbid, fate should step in
And force us into a goodbye
If you have children some day
When they point to the pictures
Please, tell 'em my name
Tell 'em how the crowds went wild
Tell 'em how I hope they shine
Long live the walls we crashed through
I had the time of my life with you
Long, long live the walls we crashed through
How the kingdom lights shined just for me and you
And I was screaming, "Long live all the magic we made"
And bring on all the pretenders, I'm not afraid
Singing, "Long live all the mountains we moved"
I had the time of my life fighting dragons with you
And long, long live that look on your face
And bring on all the pretenders
One day, we will be remembered

>>>Look What You Made Me Do Taylor Swift
<sos>
I don't like your little games
Don't like your tilted stage
The role you made me play
Of the fool, no, I don't like you
I don't like your perfect crime
How you laugh when you lie
You said the gun was mine
Isn't cool, no, I don't like you 
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
I don't like your kingdom keys
They once belonged to me
You asked me for a place to sleep
Locked me out and threw a feast 
The world moves on, another day, another drama, drama
But not for me, not for me, all I think about is karma
And then the world moves on, but one thing's for sure
Maybe I got mine, but you'll all get yours
But I got smarter, I got harder in the nick of time
Honey, I rose up from the dead, I do it all the time
I've got a list of names and yours is in red, underlined
I check it once, then I check it twice, oh!
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
I don't trust nobody and nobody trusts me
I'll be the actress starring in your bad dreams
(Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me)
"I'm sorry, the old Taylor can't come to the phone right now
"Why? Oh, 'cause she's dead!" 
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do
Look what you just made me do
Look what you just made me
Ooh, look what you made me do
Look what you made me do

Ooh, look what you made me do

>>>Love Story Taylor Swift
<sos>
We were both young when I first saw you
I close my eyes and the flashback starts
On a balcony in summer air
See the lights, see the party, the ball gowns
See you make your way through the crowd
Little did I know
That you were Romeo, you were throwing pebbles
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
And I was crying on the staircase
Begging you, "Please don't go," and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
So I sneak out to the garden to see you
We keep quiet 'cause we're dead if they knew
So close your eyes
Escape this town for a little while, oh, oh
'Cause you were Romeo, I was a scarlet letter
And my daddy said, "Stay away from Juliet"
But you were everything to me
I was begging you, "Please don't go," and I said
Romeo, take me somewhere we can be alone
I'll be waiting, all there's left to do is run
You'll be the prince and I'll be the princess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
Romeo, save me, they're trying to tell me how to feel
This love is difficult, but it's real
Don't be afraid, we'll make it out of this mess
It's a love story, baby, just say, "Yes"
But I got tired of waiting
Wondering if you were ever coming around
My faith in you was fading
When I met you on the outskirts of town and I said
"Romeo, save me, I've been feeling so alone
I keep waiting for you, but you never come
Is this in my head? I don't know what to think"
He knelt to the ground and pulled out a ring, and said
"Marry me, Juliet, you'll never have to be alone
I love you and that's all I really know
I talked to your dad, go pick out a white dress
It's a love story, baby, just say 'Yes'"
'Cause we were both young when I first saw you

>>>Lover Taylor Swift
<sos>
We could leave the Christmas lights up 'til January
And this is our place, we make the rules
And there's a dazzling haze, a mysterious way about you, dear
Have I known you twenty seconds or twenty years?
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out and take me home
You're my, my, my, my lover
We could let our friends crash in the living room
This is our place, we make the call
And I'm highly suspicious that everyone who sees you wants you
I've loved you three summers now, honey, but I want 'em all
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out and take me home 
You're my, my, my, my lover
Ladies and gentlemen, will you please stand?
With every guitar string scar on my hand
I take this magnetic force of a man to be my lover
My heart's been borrowed and yours has been blue
All's well that ends well to end up with you
Swear to be overdramatic and true to my lover
And you'll save all your dirtiest jokes for me
And at every table, I'll save you a seat, lover
Can I go where you go?
Can we always be this close?
Forever and ever, ah
Take me out and take me home 
You're my, my, my, my
Oh, you're my, my, my, my
Darling, you're my, my, my, my lover

>>>Mad Woman Taylor Swift
<sos>
What did you think I'd say to that?
Does a scorpion sting when fighting back?
They strike to kill, and you know I will
You know I will
What do you sing on your drive home?
Do you see my face in the neighbor's lawn?
Or does she mouth, "Fuck you forever"?
Every time you call me crazy, I get more crazy
And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry
And there's nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And there's nothing like a mad woman
Now I breathe flames each time I talk
My cannons all firin' at your yacht
They say "move on," but you know I won't
And women like hunting witches too
Doing your dirtiest work for you
It's obvious that wanting me dead
Has really brought you two together
Every time you call me crazy, I get more crazy
And when you say I seem angry, I get more angry
And there's nothing like a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
No one likes a mad woman
You made her like that
And you'll poke that bear 'til her claws come out
And you find something to wrap your noose around
And there's nothing like a mad woman
I'm taking my time, taking my time
'Cause you took everything from me
Watching you climb, watching you climb
Over people like me
The master of spin has a couple side flings
Good wives always know
She should be mad, should be scathing like me, but
No one likes a mad woman
What a shame she went mad
You made her like that
<eos>
>>>The Man Taylor Swift
<sos>
I would be complex, I would be cool
They'd say I played the field before I found someone to commit to
And that would be okay for me to do
Every conquest I had made would make me more of a boss to you
I’d be a fearless leader, I'd be an alpha type
When everyone believes ya, what's that like?
I’m so sick of running as fast as I can
Wonderin' if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I'm so sick of them comin' at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man 
I’d be the man 
They’d say I hustled, put in the work
They wouldn't shake their heads and question how much of this I deserve
What I was wearing, if I was rude
Could all be separated from my good ideas and power moves
And they would toast to me, oh , let the players play
I’d be just like Leo in Saint-Tropez
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wonderin' if I'd get there quicker if I was a man
And I’m so sick of them comin' at me again
'Cause if I was a man, then I'd be the man
I'd be the man 
What's it like to brag about raking in dollars
And getting bitches and models?
And it's all good if you're bad
And it's okay if you're mad
If I was out flashin' my dollars
I'd be a bitch, not a baller
They'd paint me out to be bad
So it's okay that I'm mad
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can
Wonderin' if I'd get there quicker if I was a man 
And I'm so sick of them comin' at me again 
'Cause if I was a man , then I'd be the man 
I'm so sick of running as fast as I can 
Wonderin' if I'd get there quicker if I was a man 
And I'm so sick of them comin' at me again 
'Cause if I was a man , then I'd be the man
I'd be the man 
I'd be the man 
I'd be the man 
I'd be the man 
If I was a man
Then I'd be the man

Never be so kind
You forget to be clever
Never be so clever
You forget to be kind
And if I didn't know better
I'd think you were talking to me now
If I didn't know better
I'd think you were still around
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, you're alive in my head
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, so alive
Never be so politе
You forget your power
Nevеr wield such power
You forget to be polite
And if I didn't know better
I'd think you were listening to me now
If I didn't know better
I'd think you were still around
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, you're alive in my head
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, so alive
The autumn chill that wakes me up
You loved the amber skies so much
Long limbs and frozen swims
You'd always go past where our feet could touch
And I complained the whole way there
The car ride back and up the stairs
I should've asked you questions
I should've asked you how to be
Asked you to write it down for me
Should've kept every grocery store receipt
'Cause every scrap of you would be taken from me
Watched as you signed your name Marjorie
All your closets of backlogged dreams
And how you left them all to me
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, you're alive in my head
What died didn't stay dead
You're alive, so alive
And if I didn't know better
I'd think you were singing to me now
If I didn't know better
I'd think you were still around
But I still feel you all around
But you're still around

When the morning came
We were cleaning incense off your vinyl shelf
'Cause we lost track of time again
Laughing with my feet in your lap
Like you were my closest friend
"How'd we end up on the floor, anyway?" you say
"Your roommate's cheap-ass screw-top rosé, that's how"
I see you every day now
And I chose you
The one I was dancing with
In New York, no shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was
The mark thеy saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew bеtween telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon
When the silence came
We were shaking, blind and hazy
How the hell did we lose sight of us again?
Sobbing with your head in your hands
Ain't that the way shit always ends?
You were standing hollow-eyed in the hallway
Carnations you had thought were roses, that's us
I feel you, no matter what
The rubies that I gave up
And I lost you
The one I was dancing with
In New York, no shoes
Looked up at the sky and it was 
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was 
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon
And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fucking legacy, legacy 
And I wake with your memory over me
That's a real fucking legacy to leave
The burgundy on my t-shirt
When you splashed your wine into me
And how the blood rushed into my cheeks
So scarlet, it was maroon
The mark they saw on my collarbone
The rust that grew between telephones
The lips I used to call home
So scarlet, it was maroon

Once upon a time, the planets and the fates
And all the stars aligned
You and I ended up in the same room
At the same time
And the touch of a hand lit the fuse
Of a chain reaction of countermoves
To assess the equation of you
Checkmate, I couldn't lose
What if I told you none of it was accidental?
And the first night that you saw me
Nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork, and then
The dominoes cascaded in a line
What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
And now you're mine
It was all by dеsign
'Cause I'm a mastermind
You see, all the wisеst women
Had to do it this way
'Cause we were born to be the pawn
In every lover's game
If you fail to plan, you plan to fail
Strategy sets the scene for the tale
I'm the wind in our free-flowing sails
And the liquor in our cocktails
What if I told you none of it was accidental?
And the first night that you saw me
I knew I wanted your body
I laid the groundwork, and then
The dominoes cascaded in a line
What if I told you I'm a mastermind?
And now you're mine
It was all my design
'Cause I'm a mastermind
No one wanted to play with me as a little kid
So I've been scheming like a criminal ever since
To make them love me and make it seem effortless
This is the first time I've felt the need to confess
I'm only cryptic and Machiavellian
So I told you none of it was accidental
And the first night that you saw me
Nothing was gonna stop me
I laid the groundwork, and then
Saw a wide smirk on your face
You knew the entire time
You knew that I'm a mastermind
And now you're mine
Yeah, all you did was smile
'Cause I'm a mastermind

You, with your words like knives
And swords and weapons that you use against me
You have knocked me off my feet again
Got me feeling like I'm nothing
You, with your voice like nails on a chalkboard
Calling me out when I'm wounded
You, pickin' on the weaker man
Well, you can take me down
With just one single blow
But you don't know what you don't know
Someday, I'll be livin' in a big, ole city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
You, with your switching sides
And your wildfire lies and your humiliation
You have pointed out my flaws again
As if I don't already see them
I walk with my head down, trying to block you out
'Cause I'll never impress you
I just wanna feel okay again
I bet you got pushed around
Somebody made you cold
But the cycle ends right now
'Cause you can't lead me down that road
And you don't know what you don't know
Someday, I'll be livin' in a big, ole city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
And I can see you years from now in a bar
Talking over a football game
With that same big, loud opinion
Washed up and ranting about the same old bitter things
Drunk and grumblin' on about how I can't sing
But all you are is mean
All you are is mean
And a liar, and pathetic
And alone in life, and mean
And mean, and mean, and mean
But someday, I'll be livin' in a big, ole city
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Yeah, someday, I'll be big enough so you can't hit me
And all you're ever gonna be is mean
Why you gotta be so mean?
Someday, I'll be livin' in a big, ole city

He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight
My town was a wasteland
Full of cages, full of fences
Pageant queens and big pretenders
But for some, it was paradise
My boy was a montage
A slow-motion, love potion
Jumping off things in the ocean
I broke his heart 'cause he was nice
He was sunshine, I was midnight rain
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight
It came like a postcard
Picture perfect shiny family
But for him, it's every day
So I peered through a window
A deep portal, time travel
All the love we unravel
And the life I gave away
'Cause he was sunshine, I was midnight rain
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight rain
He wanted it comfortable, I wanted that pain
He wanted a bride, I was making my own name
Chasing that fame, he stayed the same
All of me changed like midnight
I guess sometimes we all get
Just what we wanted, just what we wanted
And he never thinks of me
Except for when I'm on TV
I guess sometimes we all get
Some kind of haunted, some kind of haunted
And I never think of him
Except on midnights like this

>>>Mine Taylor Swift

You were in college working part time waitin' tables
Left a small town, never looked back
I was a flight risk with a fear of falling
Wonderin' why we bother with love if it never lasts
I say, "Can you believe it?"
As we're lyin' on the couch
The moment I could see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now
Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Flash forward and we're takin' on the world together
And there's a drawer of my things at your place
You learn my secrets and you figure out why I'm guarded
You say we'll never make my parents' mistakes
But we got bills to pay
We got nothing figured out
When it was hard to take
Yes, yes, this is what I thought about
Do you remember, we were sittin' there by the water?
You put your arm around me for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
Do you remember all the city lights on the water?
You saw me start to believe for the first time
You made a rebel of a careless man's careful daughter
You are the best thing that's ever been mine
And I remember that fight, 2:30AM
As everything was slipping right out of our hands
I ran out crying and you followed me out into the street
Braced myself for the goodbye
'Cause that's all I've ever known
Then you took me by surprise
You said, "I'll never leave you alone"
You said, "I remember how we felt sitting by the water
And every time I look at you, it's like the first time
I fell in love with a careless man's careful daughter
She is the best thing that's ever been mine"
Hold on, make it last
Hold on, never turn back
Yes, yes, do you believe it? 
Yes, yes, we're gonna make it now 
Yes, yes, I can see it
Yes, yes, I can see it now

I'll get you out on the floor
And when I break, it's in a million pieces
Hush, when no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush, I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
I want you to know
I can change everything about me to fit in
You are not like the regulars
Drunk as they watch my shattered edges glisten
Hush, when no one is around, my dear
You'll find me on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
Hush, I know they said the end is near
But I'm still on my tallest tiptoes
Spinning in my highest heels, love
Shining just for you
And they called off the circus, burned the disco down
When they sent home the horses and the rodeo clowns
I'm still on that tightrope
I'm still trying everything to get you laughing at me
And I'm still a believer, but I don't know why
I've never been a natural, all I do is try, try, try
I'm still on that trapeze
I'm still trying everything to keep you looking at me
Because I'm a mirrorball
And I'll show you every version of yourself tonight

Waving homecoming queens, marching band playing
I'm lost in the lights
American glory faded before me
Now I'm feeling hopeless, ripped up my prom dress
Running through rose thorns, I saw the scoreboard
And ran for my life 
No cameras catch my pageant smile
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
It's been a long time coming, but
It's you and me, that's my whole world
They whisper in the hallway, "She's a bad, bad girl" 
The whole school is rolling fake dice
You play stupid games, you win stupid prizes
It's you and me, there's nothing like this
Miss Americana and The Heartbreak Prince 
We're so sad, we paint the town blue
Voted most likely to run away with you
My team is losing, battered and bruising
I see the high fives between the bad guys
Leave with my head hung, you are the only one
Who seems to care
American stories burning before me
I'm feeling helpless, the damsels are depressed
Boys will be boys then, where are the wise men?
Darling, I'm scared 
No cameras catch my muffled cries
I counted days, I counted miles
To see you there, to see you there
And now the storm is coming, but

We gather here, we line up, weepin' in a sunlit room
And if I'm on fire, you'll be made of ashes, too
Even on my worst day, did I deserve, babe
All the hell you gave me?
'Cause I loved you, I swear I loved you
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And you're the hero flying around, saving face
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet
We gather stones, never knowing what they'll mean
Some to throw, some to make a diamond ring
You know I didn't want to have to haunt you
But what a ghostly scene
You wear the same jewels that I gave you
As you bury me
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
'Cause when I'd fight, you used to tell me I was brave
And if I'm dead to you, why are you at the wake?
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet
And I can go anywhere I want
Anywhere I want, just not home
And you can aim for my heart, go for blood
But you would still miss me in your bones
And I still talk to you 
And when you can't sleep at night 
I didn't have it in myself to go with grace
And so the battleships will sink beneath the waves
You had to kill me, but it killed you just the same
Cursing my name, wishing I stayed
You turned into your worst fears
And you're tossing out blame, drunk on this pain
Crossing out the good years
And you're cursing my name, wishing I stayed
Look at how my tears ricochet

>>>New Romantics Taylor Swift

We're all bored, we're all so tired of everything
We wait for trains that just aren't coming
We show off our different scarlet letters
Trust me, mine is better
We're so young, but we're on the road to ruin
We play dumb, but we know exactly what we're doing
We cry tears of mascara in the bathroom
Honey, life is just a classroom
'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing
To get knocked off our feet
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free
We're all here, the lights and noise are blinding
We hang back, it's all in the timing
It's poker, he can't see it in my face
But I'm about to play my Ace 
We need love, but all we want is danger
We team up, then switch sides like a record changer
The rumors are terrible and cruel
But, honey, most of them are true
'Cause baby, I could build a castle
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle 
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby, we're the new romantics
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing 
To get knocked off our feet 
Baby, we're the new romantics
The best people in life are free
So, come on, come along with me
The best people in life are free
Please, take my hand and
Please, take me dancing and
Please, leave me stranded
It's so romantic 
'Cause baby, I could build a castle 
Out of all the bricks they threw at me 
And every day is like a battle 
But every night with us is like a dream 
'Cause baby, I could build a castle 
Out of all the bricks they threw at me
And every day is like a battle 
But every night with us is like a dream
Baby, we're the new romantics 
Come on, come along with me
Heartbreak is the national anthem 
We sing it proudly
We are too busy dancing

There's glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me from the night before, but
Don’t read the last page
But I stay when you're lost and I'm scared and you’re turning away
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day
You squeeze my hand three times in the back of the taxi
I can tell that it's gonna be a long road
I'll be there if you're the toast of the town, babe
Or if you strike out and you're crawling home
Don't read the last page
But I stay when it’s hard or it’s wrong or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I’ll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
There’s glitter on the floor after the party
Girls carrying their shoes down in the lobby
Candle wax and Polaroids on the hardwood floor
You and me forevermore
Don't read the last page
But I stay when it's hard or it's wrong or we're making mistakes
I want your midnights
But I'll be cleaning up bottles with you on New Year's Day
Hold on to the memories, they will hold on to you
And I will hold on to you
Please don't ever become a stranger
Whose laugh I could recognize anywhere
Please don't ever become a stranger

Este's a friend of mine
We meet up every Tuesday night for dinner and a glass of wine
Este's been losin' sleep
Her husband's actin' different, and it smells like infidelity
She says, "That ain't my Merlot on his mouth
That ain't my jewelry on our joint account"
No, there ain't no doubt
I think I'm gonna call him out
She says, "I think he did it, but I just can't prove it"
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
No, no body, no crime
But I ain't lettin' up until the day I die
I think he did it
Este wasn't there Tuesday night at Olive Gardеn
At her job or anywhere
Hе reports his missing wife
And I noticed when I passed his house
His truck has got some brand new tires
And his mistress moved in
Sleeps in Este's bed and everything
No, there ain't no doubt
Somebody's gotta catch him out, 'cause
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it 
I think he did it, but I just can't prove it
No, no body, no crime
But I ain't lettin' up until the day I die
I think he did it
Good thing my daddy made me get a boating license when I was fifteen
And I've cleaned enough houses to know how to cover up a scene
Good thing Este's sister's gonna swear she was with me
Good thing his mistress took out a big life insurance policy
They think she did it, but they just can't prove it
She thinks I did it, but she just can't prove it
No, no body, no crime
I wasn't lettin' up until the day he
No, no body, no crime
I wasn't lettin' up until the day he
No, no body, no crime
I wasn't lettin' up until the day he died

>>>Nothing New Taylor Swift

They tell you while you're young
"Girls, go out and have your fun"
Then they hunt and slay the ones who actually do it
Criticize the way you fly
When you're soaring through the sky
Shoot you down and then they sigh
And say, "She looks like she's been through it"
Lord, what will become of me
Once I've lost my novelty?
I've had too much to drink tonight
And I know it's sad, but this is what I think about
And I wake up in the middle of the night
It's like I can feel time moving
How can a person know everythin' at eighteen
But nothin' at twenty-two?
And will you still want me
When I'm nothing new?
How long will it be cute, all this cryin' in my room?
When you can't blame it on my youth
And roll your eyes with affection
And my cheeks are growing tired
From turning red and faking smiles
Are we only biding time 'til I lose your attention?
And someone else lights up the room 
People love an ingénue 
I've had  too much to drink tonight
How did I go from growin' up to breaking down?
And I wake up  in the middle of the night
It's like I can feel time movin'
How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothing at twenty-two?
And will you still want me
When I'm nothing new?
I know someday I'm gonna meet her, it's a fever dream
The kind of radiance you only have at seventeen
She'll know the way and then she'll say she got the map from me
I'll say I'm happy for her, then I'll cry myself to sleep
Oh, woah, oh 
Oh, woah, oh, woah, oh 
I've had  too much to drink tonight
But I wonder if they'll miss me once they drive me out
I wake up  in the middle of the night
And I can feel time moving
How can a person know everything at eighteen
But nothing at twenty-two?
And will you still want me
Will you still want me
When I'm nothing new?

It keeps me awake, the look on your face
The moment you heard the news
You're screaming inside and frozen in time
You did all that you could do
The game was rigged, the ref got tricked
The wrong ones think they’re right
You were outnumbered this time
But only the young, only the young
Only the young, only the young
So run, and run, and run
So every day now
You brace for the sound you've only heard on TV
You go to class, scared
Wondering where the best hiding spot would be
And the big bad man and his big bad clan
Their hands are stained with red
Oh, how quickly they forget
They aren't gonna help us
Too busy helping themselves
They aren't gonna change this
We gotta do it ourselves
They think that it's over
But it's just begun
Only one thing can save us
Only the young 
Only the young 
Only the young 
Only the young 
Don't say you're too tired to fight

I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
He's got a one-hand feel on the steering wheel
The other on my heart
I look around, turn the radio down
He says, "Baby, is something wrong?"
I say, "Nothin', I was just thinkin'
How we don't have a song"
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home, 'fore I said amen
Askin' God if he could play it again
I was walking up the front porch steps
After everything that day
Had gone all wrong or been trampled on
And lost and thrown away
Got to the hallway, well on my way
To my lovin' bed
I almost didn't notice all the roses
And the note that said
Our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tapping on your window
When we're on the phone and you talk real slow
'Cause it's late and your mama don't know
Our song is the way you laugh
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss her, and I should have"
And when I got home, 'fore I said amen
Askin' God if he could play it again
I've heard every album, listened to the radio
Waited for somethin' to come along
That was as good as our song
'Cause our song is the slamming screen door
Sneakin' out late, tappin' on his window
When we're on the phone and he talks real slow
'Cause it's late and his mama don't know
Our song is the way he laughs
The first date: "Man, I didn't kiss him, and I should have"
And when I got home, 'fore I said amen
Askin' God if he could play it again
Play it again, oh, yeah
I was ridin' shotgun with my hair undone
In the front seat of his car
I grabbed a pen and an old napkin
And I wrote down our song
<eos>
>>>Ours Taylor Swift
<sos>
Elevator buttons and morning air
Strangers' silence makes me want to take the stairs
If you were here, we'd laugh about their vacant stares
But right now, my time is theirs
Seems like there's always someone who disapproves
They'll judge it like they know about me and you
And the verdict comes from those with nothing else to do
The jury's out, but my choice is you
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours
You never know what people have up their sleeves
Ghosts from your past gonna jump out at me
Lurking in the shadows with their lip gloss smiles
But I don't care, 'cause right now, you're mine
Don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours
And it's not theirs to speculate if it's wrong and
Your hands are tough, but they are where mine belong and
I'll fight their doubt and give you faith with this song for you
'Cause I love the gap between your teeth
And I love the riddles that you speak
And any snide remarks from my father about your tattoos
Will be ignored, 'cause my heart is yours
So don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
And life makes love look hard
And don't you worry your pretty little mind
People throw rocks at things that shine
But they can't take what's ours
They can't take what's ours
The stakes are high, the water's rough
But this love is ours

>>>Out of the Woods Taylor Swift

Looking at it now
It all seems so simple
We were lying on your couch
You took a Polaroid of us
Then discovered 
The rest of the world was black and white
But we were in screaming color
And I remember thinking
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Looking at it now
Last December 
We were built to fall apart
Then fall back together 
Ooh, your necklace hanging from my neck
The night we couldn't quite forget
When we decided, we decided
To move the furniture so we could dance
Baby, like we stood a chance
Two paper airplanes flying, flying, flying
And I remember thinking
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet?  Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Remember when you hit the brakes too soon?
Twenty stitches in the hospital room
When you started crying, baby, I did too
But when the sun came up, I was looking at you
Remember when we couldn't take the heat?
I walked out, I said, "I'm setting you free"
But the monsters turned out to be just trees
When the sun came up, you were looking at me
You were looking at me, oh
You were looking at me
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet? 
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet? 
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet?  Are we in the clear yet? 
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good 
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods?
Are we in the clear yet? Are we in the clear yet?
Are we in the clear yet, in the clear yet? Good 
Are we out of the woods yet? Are we out of the woods yet?

Our coming-of-age has come and gone
Suddenly this summer, it's clear
I never had the courage of my convictions
As long as danger is near
And it's just around the corner, darlin'
'Cause it lives in me
No, I could never give you peace
But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
Your integrity makes me seem small
You paint dreamscapes on the wall
I talk shit with my friends, it's like I'm wasting your honor
And you know that I'd swing with you for the fences
Sit with you in the trenches
Give you my wild, give you a child
Give you the silence that only comes when two people understand each other
Family that I chose, now that I see your brother as my brother
But there's robbers to the east, clowns to the west
I'd give you my sunshine, give you my best
But the rain is always gonna come if you're standin' with me
But I'm a fire and I'll keep your brittle heart warm
If your cascade, ocean wave blues come
All these people think love's for show
But I would die for you in secret
The devil's in the details, but you got a friend in me
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?
Would it be enough if I could never give you peace?

We had one thing goin' on
I swear that it was somethin'
'Cause I don't remember who I was
Before you painted all my nights
A color I've searched for since
But one thing after another
Have to say, by the way
I just may like some explanations
Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you
But fifteen seconds later, thеy were clappin' too?
Then what did you do?
Did you lеave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question
Half-moon eyes, bad surprise
Did you realize out of time?
She was on your mind with some dickhead guy
That you saw that night
But you were on somethin'
It was one drink after another
Fuckin' politics and gender roles
And you're not sure and I don't know
Got swept away in the gray
I just may like to have a conversation
Can I ask you a question?
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room
And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you
But fifteen seconds later, they were clappin' too?
Then what did you do?
Did you leave her house in the middle of the night? Oh
Did you wish you'd put up more of a fight, oh
When she said it was too much?
Do you wish you could still touch her?
It's just a question
Does it feel like everything's just like
Second best after that meteor strike?
And what's that that I heard? That you're still with her?
That's nice, I'm sure that's what's suitable
And right, but tonight
Can I ask you a question? 
Did you ever have someone kiss you in a crowded room 
And every single one of your friends was makin' fun of you

Holdin' him for ransom, some
Some boys are tryin' too hard, he don't try at all, though
Younger than my exes, but he act like such a man, so
I see nothing better, I keep him forever

You should see the things we do, baby, mmm
In the middle of the night, in my dreams
I know I'm gonna be with you, so I take my time

Knew I was a robber first time that he saw me
Stealing hearts and running off and never sayin' sorry
But if I'm a thief, then he can join the heist, and
We'll move to an island, and
And he can be my jailer, Burton to this Taylor

Loving him is like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street
Faster than the wind, passionate as sin, ending so suddenly
Loving him is like trying to change your mind once you're already flying through the free fall
Like the colors in autumn, so bright just before they lose it all
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red
Loving him was red
Touching him was like realizing all you ever wanted was right there in front of you
Memorizing him was as easy as knowing all the words to your old favorite song
Fighting with him was like trying to solve a crossword and realizing there's no right answer
Regretting him was like wishing you never found out that love could be that strong
Losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone 
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
But loving him was red
Oh, red 
Burning red 
Remembering him comes in flashbacks and echoes
Tell myself it's time now, gotta let go
But moving on from him is impossible
When I still see it all in my head
Burning, it was red
Oh, losing him was blue like I'd never known
Missing him was dark gray, all alone 
Forgetting him was like trying to know somebody you've never met
'Cause loving him was red
Burning red 
And that's why  he's spinning 'round in my head
Comes back to me , burning red
 Yeah, yeah
His love was like driving a new Maserati down a dead-end street

I tapped on your window on your darkest night

There was nowhere for me to stay, but I stayed anyway
And if I would've known
How many pieces you had crumbled into
I might have let them lay
Are you really gonna talk about timing in times like these?
And let all your damage damage me
And carry your baggage up my street
And make me your future history, it’s time
You've come a long way, open the blinds, let me see your face
You wouldn't be the first renegade to need somebody
Is it insensitive for me to say
"Get your shit together so I can love you"?
Is it really your anxiety that stops you
From giving me everything
Or do you just not want to?
I tapped on your window on your darkest night
The shape of you was jagged and weak
There was nowhere for me to stay, but I stayed anyway
You fire off missiles ’cause you hate yourself

To need somebody, to need somebody
To need somebody, to need
Are you really gonna talk about timing in times like these?
And let all your damage damage me
And carry your baggage up my street
And make me your future history, it's time
Is it insensitive for me to say
"Get your shit together so I can love you"?
You've come a long way, open the blinds, let me see your face
You wouldn't be the first renegade to need somebody
Is it really your anxiety that stops you
From giving me everything
Or do you just not want to?
<eos>
>>>Ronan Taylor Swift
<sos>
I remember you bare feet, down the hallway
I remember your little laugh
Race cars on the kitchen floor, plastic dinosaurs
I love you to the moon and back
I remember your blue eyes looking into mine
Like we had our own secret club
I remember you dancing before bed time
Then jumping on me waking me up
I can still feel you hold my hand, little man
And even the moment I knew
You fought it hard like an army guy
Remember I leaned in and whispered to you
"Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years"
I remember the drive home
When the blind hope turned to crying and screaming, "Why?"
Flowers pile up in the worst way, no one knows what to say
About a beautiful boy who died
And it's about to be Halloween
You could be anything you wanted, if you were still here
I remember the last day, when I kissed your face
And whispered in your ear
"Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
Out of this curtained room and this hospital grey
Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years"
What if I'm standing in your closet trying to talk to you?
And what if I kept the hand-me-downs you won't grow into?
And what if I really thought some miracle would see us through?
What if the miracle was even getting one moment with you?
Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
Come on, baby, with me
We're going to fly away from here
You were my best four years
I remember you bare feet, down the hallway
I love you to the moon and back

>>>Safe & Sound Taylor Swift
<sos>
I remember tears streaming down your face when I said, "I'll never let you go"
When all those shadows almost killed your light
I remember you said, "Don't leave me here alone"
But all that's dead and gone and passed tonight
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
No one can hurt you now
You and I'll be safe and sound
Don't you dare look out your window
Darling, everything's on fire
The war outside our door keeps raging on
Hold on to this lullaby
Even when  music's gone
Just close your eyes
The sun is going down
No one can hurt you now
You and I'll be safe and sound
Just close your eyes
You and I'll be safe and sound
>>>Santa Baby Taylor Swift

Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree, for me
I have been an awful good girl, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa baby, a '54 convertible, too, light blue
Well I will wait up for you, dear, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight, yeah
Think of all the fun I have missed
Think of all the boys I have not kissed
Next year I could be just as good
If you check off my Christmas list
Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that is not a lot
I have been an angel all year, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Santa, honey, there is one more thing I really do need, the deed
To a platinum mine, Santa honey
So hurry down the chimney tonight
Come and trim my Christmas tree
With some decorations bought at Tiffany's
I really do believe in you
Let us see if you believe in me
Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing
And I do not mean on the phone, Santa baby
So hurry down the chimney tonight

>>>Seven Taylor Swift
<sos>
Please picture me in the trees
I hit my peak at seven
Feet in the swing over the creek
I was too scared to jump in
But I, I was high in the sky
With Pennsylvania under me
Are there still beautiful things?
Sweet tea in the summer
Cross your heart, won't tell no other
And though I can’t recall your face
I still got love for you
Your braids like a pattern
Love you to the Moon and to Saturn
Passed down like folk songs
The love lasts so long
And I've been meaning to tell you
I think your house is haunted
Your dad is always mad and that must be why
And I think you should come live with me
And we can be pirates
Then you won't have to cry
Or hide in the closet
And just like a folk song
Our love will be passed on
Please picture me in the weeds
Before I learned civility
I used to scream ferociously
Any time I wanted
Sweet tea in the summer
Cross my heart, won’t tell no other
And though I can't recall your face
I still got love for you
Pack your dolls and a sweater
We'll move to India forever
Passed down like folk songs
Our love lasts so long
<eos>
>>>Should've Said No Taylor Swift
<sos>
It's strange to think the songs we used to sing
The smiles, the flowers, everything is gone
Yesterday, I found out about you
Even now, just lookin' at you feels wrong
You say that you'd take it all back
It was a moment of weakness
And you said yes
You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her'd get back to me 
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me
You can see that I've been cryin'
And baby, you know all the right things to say
But do you honestly expect me to believe
We could ever be the same?
You say that the past is the past
You need one chance
It was a moment of weakness
And you said yes
You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her’d get back to me 
And I should've been there in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me
Before you go, tell me this
Was it worth it?
Was she worth this?
No, no, no, no
You should've said no, you should've gone home
You should've thought twice 'fore you let it all go
You should've known that word
'Bout what you did with her’d get back to me 
And I should've been there, in the back of your mind
I shouldn't be asking myself why
You shouldn't be begging for forgiveness at my feet
You should've said no
Baby, and you might still have me

>>>Snow on the Beach Taylor Swift
<sos>
One night, a few moons ago
I saw flecks of what could've been lights
But it might just have been you
Passing by unbeknownst to me
Life is emotionally abusive
And time can't stop me quite like you did
And my flight was awful, thanks for asking
I'm unglued, thanks to you
And it's like snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
But it's comin' down
No sound, it's all around
Like snow on the beach
This scene feels like what I once saw on a screen
I searched "aurora borealis green"
I've never seen someone lit from within
Blurring out my periphery
My smile is like I won a contest
And to hide that would be so dishonest
And it's fine to fake it 'til you make it
'Til you do, 'til it's true
Now it's like snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
But it's comin' down
No sound, it's all around
Like snow on the beach
I  can't  speak, afraid to jinx it
I  don't  even dare to wish it
But your eyes are flying saucers from another planet
Now I'm all for you like Janet
Can this be a real thing? Can it?
Are we falling like snow at the beach? 
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream 
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me 
But it's comin' down
No sound, it's all around
Like snow on the beach 
Like snow on the beach 
Like snow on the beach 
But it's comin' down
No sound, it's all around
Like snow on the beach
<eos>
>>>Sparks Fly Taylor Swift
<sos>
The way you move is like a full on rainstorm and I'm a house of cards
You're the kind of reckless that should send me runnin'
But I kinda know that I won't get far
And you stood there in front of me, just close enough to touch
Close enough to hope you couldn't see what I was thinkin' of
Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
My mind forgets to remind me you're a bad idea
You touch me once and it's really somethin'
You find I'm even better than you imagined I would be
I'm on my guard for the rest of the world
But with you, I know it's no good
And I could wait patiently, but I really wish you would
Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk, take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
I run my fingers through your hair and watch the lights go wild
Just keep on keepin' your eyes on me, it's just wrong enough to make it feel right
And lead me up the staircase, won't you whisper soft and slow?
I'm captivated by you, baby, like a firework show
Drop everything now, meet me in the pouring rain
Kiss me on the sidewalk , take away the pain
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
Get me with those green eyes, baby, as the lights go down
Give me something that'll haunt me when you're not around
'Cause I see sparks fly whenever you smile
And the sparks fly
And the sparks fly
<eos>
>>>Speak Now Taylor Swift
<sos>
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl
I sneak in and see your friends
And her snotty little family all dressed in pastel
And she is yelling at a bridesmaid
Somewhere back inside a room
Wearin' a gown shaped like a pastry
This is surely not what you thought it would be
I lose myself in a daydream
Where I stand and say
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now"
Fond gestures are exchanged
And the organ starts to play a song that sounds like a death march
And I am hiding in the curtains
It seems that I was uninvited by your lovely bride-to-be
She floats down the aisle like a pageant queen
But I know you wish it was me
You wish it was me, don't you?
Don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
And they said, "Speak now"
Don't say yes, run away now 
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow 
Your time is running out
And they said, "Speak now"
Ooh , la
Ooh , ooh
I hear the preacher say
"Speak now or forever hold your peace"
There's the silence, there's my last chance
I stand up with shaky hands, all eyes on me
Horrified looks from everyone in the room
But I'm only lookin' at you
I am not the kind of girl
Who should be rudely bargin' in on a white veil occasion
But you are not the kind of boy
Who should be marrying the wrong girl, haha
So, don't say yes, run away now
I'll meet you when you're out
Of the church, at the back door
Don't wait or say a single vow
You need to hear me out
They said, "Speak now"
And you say, "Let's run away now 
I'll meet you when I'm out
Of my tux, at the back door
Baby, I didn't say my vows 
So glad you were around
When they said, 'Speak now'"
<eos>
>>>State of Grace Taylor Swift
<sos>
I'm walking fast through the traffic lights
Busy streets and busy lives
And all we know is touch and go
We are alone with our changing minds
We fall in love 'til it hurts or bleeds
Or fades in time
And I never 
And I’ll never 
You come around and the armor falls
Pierce the room like a cannonball
Now, all we know is don’t let go
We are alone, just you and me
Up in your room and our slates are clean
Just twin fire signs, four blue eyes
So you were never a saint
And I've loved in shades of wrong
We learn to live with the pain
But this love is brave and wild
And I never 
And I’ll never 
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
These are the hands of fate
You’re my Achilles heel
This is the golden age
Of something good and right and real
And I never 
And I’ll never 
Be the same 
This is a state of grace
This is the worthwhile fight
Love is a ruthless game
Unless you play it good and right
<eos>
>>>The Story of Us Taylor Swift
<sos>
I used to think, one day, we'd tell the story of us
How we met and the sparks flew instantly
And people would say, "They're the lucky ones"
I used to know my place was the spot next to you
Now, I'm searching the room for an empty seat
'Cause lately, I don't even know what page you're on
Oh, a simple complication
Miscommunications lead to fallout
So many things that I wish you knew
So many walls up, I can't break through
Now, I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
And we're not speakin'
And I'm dyin' to know
Is it killin' you like it's killin' me? Yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
How'd we end up this way?
See me nervously pulling at my clothes and trying to look busy
And you're doin' your best to avoid me
I'm starting to think, one day, I'll tell the story of us
How I was losing my mind when I saw you here
But you held your pride like you should've held me
Oh, I'm scared to see the ending
Why are we pretending this is nothin'?
I'd tell you I miss you, but I don't know how
I've never heard silence quite this loud
Now, I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
And we're not speakin'

Is it killin' you like it's killin' me? Yeah
I don't know what to say since the twist of fate
When it all broke down
And the story of us looks a lot like a tragedy now
This is lookin' like a contest
Of who can act like they care less
But I liked it better when you were on my side
The battle's in your hands now
But I would lay my armor down
If you said you'd rather love than fight
So many things that you wish I knew
But the story of us might be ending soon
Now, I'm standin' alone in a crowded room
And we're not speakin'
And I'm dyin' to know
Is it killin' you like it's killin' me? Yeah
And I don't know what to say since the twist of fate

You come and pick me up, no headlights
Could end in burning flames or paradise
Fade into view, oh
It's been a while since I have even heard from you
And I should just tell you to leave, 'cause I
Know exactly where it leads, but I
Watch us go 'round and 'round each time
You got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time
'Cause we never go out of style, we never go out of style
You got that long hair, slicked back, white t-shirt
And I got that good girl faith and a tight little skirt
And when we go crashing down, we come back every time

Can't stop thinking 'bout you and I"
I said, "I've been there too a few times"
'Cause you got that James Dean daydream look in your eye
And I got that red lip classic thing that you like

>>>Sweet Nothing Taylor Swift

I spy with my little tired eye
Tiny as a firefly
A pebble that we picked up last July
Down deep inside your pocket
We almost forgot it
Does it ever miss Wicklow sometimes?
They said the end is comin'
Everyone’s up to somethin'
I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
Outside, they’re push and shovin'
You're in the kitchen hummin'
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'
On the way home
I wrote a poem
You say, "What a mind"
This happens all the time
'Causе they said the end is comin'
Evеryone's up to somethin’
I find myself runnin’ home to your sweet nothings
Outside, they're push and shovin’
You're in the kitchen hummin'
All that you ever wanted from me was nothin'
Industry disruptors and soul deconstructors
And smooth-talking hucksters out glad-handing each other
And the voices that implore, "You should be doing more"
To you, I can admit that I’m just too soft for all of it
They said the end is comin'
Everyone's up to somethin'
I find myself runnin' home to your sweet nothings
Outside, they're push and shovin'
You're in the kitchen hummin'
All that you ever wanted from me was sweet nothin'

Hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground 
Only sound, only sound that you hear is "no"
You never saw it coming
Slipped when you started running
And now you've come undone and 
Seen you fall, seen you crawl on your knees 
Seen you lost in a crowd, seen your colors fade
Wish I could make it better
Someday you won't remember
This pain you thought would last forever and ever
There you stand, ten feet tall
I will say, "I knew it all along"
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction
Just a shot, just a shot in the dark 
All you got, all you got are your shattered hopes
They never saw it coming
You hit the ground running
And now you're on to something
I, I, I say
What a sight, what a sight when the light came on
Proved me right, proved me right when you proved them wrong
And in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember

Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction
There you stand, next to me
All at once, the rest is history
Your eyes are wider than distance
This life is sweeter than fiction, fiction

Look at you now, look at you now, now
I’ll be one of the many saying
You made us proud, you made us proud, proud
I’ll be one of the many saying
Look at you now, look at you now, now
I’ll be one of the many saying
You made us proud, you made us proud, proud
And when they call your name
And they put your picture in a frame
You know that I’ll be there time and again
'Cause I loved you when
When you hit the ground, hit the ground, hit the ground, oh oh
Only sound, only sound that you heard was "no"
Now in this perfect weather
It's like we don't remember
The rain we thought would last forever and ever
There you stand, ten feet tall

I fake a smile so he won't see
That I want and I'm needing
Everything that we should be
I'll bet she's beautiful, that girl he talks about
And she's got everything that I have to live without
Drew talks to me
I laugh 'cause it's just so funny
That I can't even see
Anyone when he's with me
He says he's so in love, he's finally got it right
I wonder if he knows he's all I think about at night
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishin' on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
Drew walks by me
Can he tell that I can't breathe?
And there he goes, so perfectly
The kind of flawless I wish I could be
She'd better hold him tight, give him all her love
Look in those beautiful eyes and know she's lucky 'cause
He's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only thing that keeps me wishin' on a wishing star
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
So I'll drive home alone as I turn off the light
I'll put his picture down and maybe get some sleep tonight
'Cause he's the reason for the teardrops on my guitar
The only one who's got enough of me to break my heart
He's the song in the car I keep singing, don't know why I do
He's the time taken up, but there's never enough
And he's all that I need to fall into
Drew looks at me
I fake a smile, so he won't see

<sos>
You said, "I know"
When I said, "I need some time, need some space
To think about all of this"
And you watched me go
And I knew my words were hard to hear
And harder to ever take back
And I said, "When can I-I-I come back?"
And you said, "That's when
When I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
Laughing, when I'm crying
And that's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I see your face
I'll let you in, and baby, that's when"
I said, "I know"
When you said, "I did you wrong, made mistakes
And put you through all of this" 
Then through the phone
Came all your tears
And I said, "Leave those all in our past"
And you said, "When can I-I-I come back?"
And I said, "That's when
When I wake up in the morning
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
Laughing, when I'm crying
And that's when I'll be waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I see your face
I'll let you in, and baby, that's when"
And you said, "Honestly
When you were gone
Did you ever think of me?"
"That's when, when I woke up in the morning
That's when it was sunny or storming
Laughing, when I was crying
And that's when you were waiting at the front gate
That's when, when I saw your face
You let me in, and baby, that's when"
That's when, when I wake up in the morning 
That's when, when it's sunny or storming
When I'm laughing, when I'm crying
That's when I miss you, that's when I want you
That's when I love you, that's when
<eos>
>>>This Is Me Trying Taylor Swift
<sos>
I've been having a hard time adjusting
I had the shiniest wheels, now they're rusting
I didn't know if you'd care if I came back
I have a lot of regrets about that
Pulled the car off the road to the lookout
Could've followed my fears all the way down
And maybe I don't quite know what to say
But I'm here in your doorway
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
They told me all of my cages were mental
So I got wasted like all my potential
And my words shoot to kill when I'm mad
I have a lot of regrets about that
I was so ahead of the curve, the curve became a sphere
Fell behind all my classmates and I ended up here
Pouring out my heart to a stranger
But I didn't pour the whiskey
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
At least I'm trying
And it's hard to be at a party when I feel like an open wound
It's hard to be anywhere these days when all I want is you
You're a flashback in a film reel on the one screen in my town
And I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
I just wanted you to know that this is me trying
At least I'm trying
<eos>
>>>Tim McGraw Taylor Swift
<sos>
He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"
Just a boy in a Chevy truck
That had a tendency of gettin' stuck
On backroads at night
And I was right there beside him all summer long
And then the time we woke up to find that summer gone
But when you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
September saw a month of tears
And thankin' God that you weren't here
To see me like that
But in a box beneath my bed
Is a letter that you never read
From three summers back
It's hard not to find it all a little bittersweet
And lookin' back on all of that, it's nice to believe
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
The one we danced to all night long
The moon like a spotlight on the lake
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
And I'm back for the first time since then
I'm standin' on your street
And there's a letter left on your doorstep
And the first thing that you'll read
Is, "When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think my favorite song
Someday you'll turn your radio on
I hope it takes you back to that place"
When you think happiness
I hope you think that little black dress
Think of my head on your chest
And my old faded blue jeans
When you think Tim McGraw
I hope you think of me
Oh, think of me, mmm
He said the way my blue eyes shined
Put those Georgia stars to shame that night
I said, "That's a lie"
<eos>
>>>'Tis the Damn Season Taylor Swift
<sos>
If I wanted to know who you were hanging with
While I was gone, I would've asked you
It's the kind of cold, fogs up windshield glass
But I felt it when I passed you
There's an ache in you, put there by the ache in me
But if it's all the same to you
It's the same to me
So we could call it even
You could call me "babe" for the weekend
​'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown
I parkеd my car right between the Methodist
And thе school that used to be ours
The holidays linger like bad perfume
You can run, but only so far
I escaped it too, remember how you watched me leave
But if it's okay with you, it's okay with me
We could call it even
You could call me "babe" for the weekend
​'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown
Sleep in half the day just for old times' sake
I won't ask you to wait if you don't ask me to stay
So I'll go back to L.A. and the so-called friends
Who'll write books about me if I ever make it
And wonder about the only soul
Who can tell which smiles I'm fakin'
And the heart I know I'm breakin' is my own
To leave the warmest bed I've ever known
We could call it even
Even though I'm leaving
And I'll be yours for the weekend
​'Tis the damn season
We could call it even
You could call me "babe" for the weekend
​'Tis the damn season, write this down
I'm stayin' at my parents' house
And the road not taken looks real good now
Time flies, messy as the mud on your truck tires
Now I'm missing your smile, hear me out
We could just ride around
And the road not taken looks real good now
And it always leads to you and my hometown
It always leads to you and my hometown

>>>Today Was a Fairytale Taylor Swift
<sos>
Today was a fairytale, you were the prince
I used to be a damsel in distress
You took me by the hand and you picked me up at six
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale, I wore a dress
You wore a dark gray t-shirt
You told me I was pretty when I looked like a mess
Today was a fairytale
Well, can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale, you've got a smile
That takes me to another planet
Every move you make, everything you say is right
Today was a fairytale
Today was a fairytale, all that I can say
Is now it's getting so much clearer
Nothing made sense 'til the time I saw your face
Today was a fairytale
Whenever you're around, yeah
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
I can feel my heart
It's beating in my chest
Did you feel it?
I can't put this down
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
But can you feel this magic in the air?
It must have been the way you kissed me
Fell in love when I saw you standing there
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
It must have been the way
Today was a fairytale
Oh, oh, yeah, oh
Today was a fairytale

>>>Treacherous Taylor Swift
<sos>
Put your lips close to mine
As long as they don't touch
Out of focus, eye to eye
'Til the gravity's too much
And I'll do anything you say
If you say it with your hands
And I'd be smart to walk away
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
And I-I-I like it
I can't decide if it's a choice
I hear the sound of my own voice
Asking you to stay
And all we are is skin and bone
Trained to get along
Forever going with the flow
This slope is treacherous
This path is reckless
This slope is treacherous
I, I, I like it
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
This hope is treacherous
This daydream is dangerous
This hope is treacherous
Two headlights shine through the sleepless night
And I will get you, get you alone
Your name has echoed through my mind
And I just think you should, think you should know
That nothing safe is worth the drive
And I would follow you, follow you home
I'll follow you, follow you home
This slope is treacherous

I remember what you wore on the first day
You came into my life and I thought
"Hey, you know, this could be something"
'Cause everything you do and words you say
You know that it all takes my breath away
And now I'm left with nothing
So maybe it's true that I can't live without you
And maybe two is better than one
But there's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two is better than one
I remember every look upon your face
The way you roll your eyes, the way you taste
You make it hard for breathing
'Cause when I close my eyes and drift away
I think of you and everything's okay
I'm finally now believing
Then maybe it's true that I can't live without you
And maybe two is better than one
But there's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking two is better than one
I remember what you wore on the first day
You came into my life and I thought, hey 
Maybe it's true that I can't live without you
And maybe two is better than one
But there's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
And you've already got me coming undone
And I'm thinking, ooh, I can't live without you
'Cause, baby, two is better than one
There's so much time to figure out the rest of my life
But I'll figure out with all that's said and done
Two is better than one
Two is better than one

>>>Vigilante Shit Taylor Swift
<sos>
Draw the cat eye sharp enough to kill a man
You did some bad things, but I'm the worst of them
Sometimes I wonder which one'll be your last lie
They say looks can kill and I might try
I don't dress for women
I don't dress for men
Lately, I've been dressin' for revenge
I don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even
So on the weekends
I don't dress for friends
Lately, I've been dressin' for revenge
She needed cold, hard proof, so I gave her some
She had the envelope, where you think she got it from?
Now she gets the house, gets the kids, gets the pride
Picture me thick as thieves with your ex-wife
And she looks so pretty
Drivin' in your Benz
Lately, she's been dressin' for revenge
She don't start shit, but she can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even
So on the weekends
She don't dress for friends
Lately, she's been dressing for revenge
Ladies always rise above
Ladies know what people want
Someone sweet and kind and fun
The lady simply had enough
While he was doin' lines and crossin' all of mine
Someone told his white-collar crimes to the FBI
And I don't dress for villains
I'm on my vigilante shit again
I don't start shit, but I can tell you how it ends
Don't get sad, get even
So on the weekends
I don't dress for friends
Lately, I've been dressin' for revenge

>>>Welcome to New York Taylor Swift
<sos>
Walking through a crowd, the village is aglow
Kaleidoscope of loud heartbeats under coats
Everybody here wanted something more
Searching for a sound we hadn't heard before
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat, forevermore
The lights are so bright but they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
When we first dropped our bags on apartment floors
Took our broken hearts, put them in a drawer
Everybody here was someone else before
And you can want who you want
Boys and boys and girls and girls
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat, beat, forevermore
The lights are so bright, but they never blind me, me
Welcome to New York , it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Like any great love, it keeps you guessing
Like any real love, it's ever-changing
Like any true love, it drives you crazy
But you know you wouldn't change anything, anything, anything
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
Welcome to New York, it's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York, welcome to New York
It's a new soundtrack, I could dance to this beat
The lights are so bright, but they never blind me
Welcome to New York 
It's been waiting for you
Welcome to New York
The lights are so bright but they never blind me
Welcome to New York
So bright, they never blind me
Welcome to New York

>>>White Horse Taylor Swift
<sos>
Say you're sorry, that face of an angel
Comes out just when you need it to
As I paced back and forth all this time
'Cause I honestly believed in you
Holdin' on, the days drag on
Stupid girl, I shoulda known, I shoulda known
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now, it's too late for you and your white horse
Maybe I was naive, got lost in your eyes
And never really had a chance
My mistake, I didn't know to be in love
You had to fight to have the upper hand
I had so many dreams about you and me
Happy endings, now, I know
That I'm not a princess, this ain't a fairytale
I'm not the one you'll sweep off her feet, lead her up the stairwell
This ain't Hollywood, this is a small town
I was a dreamer before you went and let me down
Now, it's too late for you and your white horse
And there you are on your knees
Beggin' for forgiveness, beggin' for me
Just like I always wanted
But I'm so sorry
'Cause I'm not your princess, this ain't our fairytale
I'm gonna find someone someday who might actually treat me well
This is a big world, that was a small town
There in my rear view mirror disappearing now
And it's too late for you and your white horse
Now, it's too late for you and your white horse
To catch me now
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Try and catch me now, oh
It's too late to catch me now

>>>Wildest Dreams Taylor Swift
<sos>
He said, "Let's get out of this town
Drive out of the city, away from the crowds"
I thought, "Heaven can't help me now"
But this is gonna take me down
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
I can see the end as it begins
My one condition is
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
I said, "No one has to know what we do"
His hands are in my hair, his clothes are in my room
And his voice is a familiar sound
But this is gettin' good now
He's so tall and handsome as hell
He's so bad, but he does it so well
And when we've had our very last kiss
My last request is
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your
Wildest dreams, ah, ha
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
You'll see me in hindsight
Tangled up with you all night
Burnin'  it  down 
Someday, when you leave me
I bet these memories
Follow  you  around
Say you'll remember me
Standing in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just pretend
Say you'll remember me
Standin' in a nice dress
Starin' at the sunset, babe
Red lips and rosy cheeks
Say you'll see me again
Even if it's just in your 
Wildest dreams, ah, ha 
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha
Even if it's just in your
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha
In your wildest dreams, ah, ha

>>>Willow Taylor Swift
<sos>
I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night
Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife
And if it was an open-shut case
I never would've known from that look on your face
Lost in your current like a priceless wine
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
Head on the pillow, I could feel you sneakin' in
As if you were a mythical thing
Like you were a trophy or a champion ring
And there was one prize I'd cheat to win
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
They count me out time and time again
Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind
But I come back stronger than a '90s trend
Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark
Show me the places where the others gave you scars
Now this is an open-shut case
I guess I should've known from the look on your face
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
The more that you say, the less I know
Wherever you stray, I follow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
You know that my train could take you home
Anywhere else is hollow
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man
Hey, that's my man
Yeah, that's my man
Every bait-and-switch was a work of art
Hey, that's my man
I'm begging for you to take my hand
Wreck my plans, that's my man

>>>Would've, Could've, Should've Taylor Swift
<sos>
If you would've blinked, then I would've
Looked away at the first glance
If you tasted poison, you could've
Spit me out at the first chance
And if I was some paint, did it splatter
On a promising grown man?
And if I was a child, did it matter
If you got to wash your hands?
Ooh, all I used to do was pray
If you'd never looked my way
I would've stayed on my knees
And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil
And the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know, I wish you'd left me wondering
If you never touched me, I would've
Gone along with the righteous
If I never blushed, then they could've
Never whispered about this
And if you never saved me from boredom
I could've gone on as I was
But, Lord, you made me feel important
And then you tried to erase us
Ooh, you're a crisis of my faith
If I'd only played it safe
I would've stayed on my knees
And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil
And the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know, I wish you'd left me wondering
God rest my soul
I miss who I used to be
The tomb won't close
Stained glass windows in my mind
I regret you all the time
I can't let this go
I fight with you in my sleep
The wound won't close
I keep on waiting for a sign
I regret you all the time
If clarity's in death, then why won't this die?
Years of tearing down our banners, you and I
Living for the thrill of hitting you where it hurts
Give me back my girlhood, it was mine first
And I damn sure never would've danced with the devil
And the God's honest truth is that the pain was heaven
And now that I'm grown, I'm scared of ghosts
Memories feel like weapons
And now that I know, I wish you'd left me wondering
God rest my soul
I miss who I used to be
The tomb won't close
Stained glass windows in my mind
I regret you all the time
I can't let this go
I fight with you in my sleep
The wound won't close
I keep on waiting for a sign
I regret you all the time
Oh, God rest my soul
I miss who I used to be
The tomb won't close
Stained glass windows in my mind
I regret you all the time
I can't let this go
I fight with you in my sleep
The wound won't close
I keep on waiting for a sign
I regret you all the time

>>>You All Over Me Taylor Swift
<sos>
Once the last drop of rain has dried off the pavement
Shouldn't I find a stain? But I never do
The way the tires turn stones on old county roads
They leave 'em muddy underneath, reminds me of you
You find graffiti on the walls of old bathroom stalls, you know
You can scratch it right off, it's how it used to be
But like the dollar in your pocket, it's been spent and traded in
You can't change where it's been, reminds me of me
I lived and I learned
Had you, got burned
Held out and held on
God knows, too long, and wasted time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me
The best and worst day of June
Was the one that I met you
With your hands in your pockets
And your "Don't you wish you had me?" grin
Well I did, so I smiled, and I melted like a child
Now, every breath of air I breathe reminds me of then
And I lived and I learned
Had you, got burned
Held out and held on
God knows, too long, and wasted time
Lost tears, swore that I'd get out of here
But no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me
I lived and I learned
And found out what it was to turn around
And see that we
Were never really meant to be
So I lied, and I cried
And I watched a part of myself die
'Cause no amount of freedom gets you clean
I've still got you all over me
Still got you all over me
<eos>
>>>You Belong with Me Taylor Swift
<sos>
You're on the phone with your girlfriend, she's upset
She's going off about something that you said
'Cause she doesn't get your humor like I do
I'm in the room, it's a typical Tuesday night
I'm listening to the kind of music she doesn't like
And she'll never know your story like I do
But she wears short skirts, I wear T-shirts
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me, you belong with me
Walking the streets with you and your worn-out jeans
I can't help thinking this is how it ought to be
Laughing on a park bench, thinking to myself
Hey, isn't this easy?
And you've got a smile that could light up this whole town
I haven't seen it in a while since she brought you down
You say you're fine, I know you better than that
Hey, whatcha doing with a girl like that?
She wears high heels, I wear sneakers
She's Cheer Captain and I'm on the bleachers
Dreaming 'bout the day when you wake up and find
That what you're looking for has been here the whole time
If you could see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time, how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me
Oh, I remember you driving to my house
In the middle of the night
I'm the one who makes you laugh
When you know you're 'bout to cry
And I know your favorite songs
And you tell me 'bout your dreams
Think I know where you belong
Think I know it's with me
Can't you see that I'm the one who understands you
Been here all along, so why can't you see?
You belong with me
Standing by and waiting at your back door
All this time, how could you not know, baby?
You belong with me, you belong with me
You belong with me
Have you ever thought just maybe
You belong with me?
You belong with me

>>>You're Losing Me Taylor Swift
<sos>
You say, "I don't understand," and I say, "I know you don't"
We thought a cure would come through in time, now, I fear it won't
Remember lookin' at this room, we loved it 'cause of the light
Now, I just sit in the dark and wonder if it's time
Do I throw out everything we built or keep it?
I'm getting tired even for a phoenix
Always risin' from the ashes
Mendin' all her gashes
You might just have dealt the final blow
Stop, you're losin' me
I can't find a pulse
My heart won't start anymore for you
'Cause you're losin' me
Every mornin', I glared at you with storms in my eyes
How can you say that you love someone you can't tell is dyin'?
I sent you signals and bit my nails down to the quick
My face was gray, but you wouldn't admit that we were sick
And the air is thick with loss and indecision
I know my pain is such an imposition
Now, you're runnin' down the hallway
And you know what they all say
"You don't know what you got until it's gone"
Stop, you're losin' me
I can't find a pulse
My heart won't start anymore for you
'Cause you're losin' me
Stop  'cause you're losin' me
My heart won't start anymore
How long could we be a sad song
'Til we were too far gone to bring back to life?
I gave you all my best me's, my endless empathy
And all I did was bleed as I tried to be the bravest soldier
Fighting in only your army, frontlines, don't you ignore me
I'm the best thing at this party 
And I wouldn't marry me either
A pathological people pleaser
Who only wanted you to see her
And I'm fadin', thinkin'
"Do something, babe, say something" 
"Lose something, babe, risk something" 
"Choose something, babe, I got nothing" 
"To believe, unless you're choosin' me"
Stop , you're losin' me
I can't find a pulse
My heart won't start anymore

>>>You're Not Sorry Taylor Swift
<sos>
All this time I was wasting hoping you would come around
I've been giving out chances every time and all you do is let me down
And it's taken me this long, baby, but I've figured you out
And you're thinking we'll be fine again, but not this time around
You don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry 
You're looking so innocent, I might believe you if I didn't know
Could've loved you all my life if you hadn't left me waiting in the cold
And you've got your share of secrets
And I'm tired of being last to know, oh
And now, you're asking me to listen 'cause it's worked each time before
But you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
Don't wanna hurt anymore
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry 
You had me crawling for you, honey, and it never would've gone away, no
You used to shine so bright, but I watched all of it fade
So you don't have to call anymore
I won't pick up the phone
This is the last straw
There's nothing left to beg for
And you can tell me that you're sorry
But I don't believe you, baby, like I did before
You're not sorry 
Woah, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh

>>>You're on Your Own, Kid Taylor Swift
<sos>
Summer went away, still, the yearning stays
I play it cool with the best of them
I wait patiently, he's gonna notice me
It's okay, we're the best of friends
I hear it in your voice, you're smoking with your boys
I touch my phone as if it's your face
I didn't choose this town, I dream of getting out
There's just one who could make me stay
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I waited ages to see you there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that you never cared
You're on your own, kid
You always have been
I see the great escape, so long, Daisy May
I picked the petals, he loves me not
Something different bloomed, writing in my room
I play my songs in the parking lot
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I called a taxi to take me there
I search the party of better bodies
Just to learn that my dreams aren't rare
You're on your own, kid
You always have been
From sprinkler splashes to fireplace ashes
I gave my blood, sweat, and tears for this
I hosted parties and starved my body
Like I'd be saved by a perfect kiss
The jokes weren't funny, I took the money
My friends from home don't know what to say
I looked around in a blood-soaked gown
And I saw something they can't take away
'Cause there were pages turned with the bridges burned
Everything you lose is a step you take
So, make the friendship bracelets, take the moment and taste it
You've got no reason to be afraid
You're on your own, kid
Yeah, you can face this
You're on your own, kid
You always have been

>>>7 Summers Morgan Wallen
<sos>
Yeah, you used to talk about
Getting even further South
Somewhere where the summer lasted all year 'round
Probably got a big ol' diamond on your hand right now
Maybe a baby or a couple by now
Long driveway to a big white house
But I wonder when you're drinking if you
Find yourself thinking about
That boy from East Tennessee
And I know we both knew better
But we still said forever
And that was seven summers
Of Coke and Southern Comfort
Were we dumb or just younger, who knows?
Back then, you used to love the river
And sippin' on a sixer with me
Does it ever make you sad to know
That was seven summers ago?
Yeah, I bet your daddy's so proud
Of how his little girl turned out
Think she dodged a bullet
Of a good old boy like me
Go drinkin', same friends on Friday
Bought a few acres, couple roads off the highway
Guess you never saw things my way anyway
But I wonder when you're drinking if you
Find yourself thinking about
That boy from East Tennessee
And I know we both knew better
But we still said forever
And that was seven summers
Of Coke and Southern Comfort
Were we dumb or just younger, who knows?
Back then, you used to love the river

2 AM at a Broadway bar
She's puttin’ her number in my phone 
Two Bud Lights deep, and she's sayin' things she don’t mean
I met her down at Aldean's
She said that she saw me walkin' in about a mile away
Bean just had to take her phone and that just took her smile away
She said I'm too drunk and crazy, she don't like the way I dance
I said, "You don't have to join in," she said she'd take a chance
I've been kinda crazy ever since it went down
I get kind of lost, and, baby, this what I found
Girls like you just wanna take me around, around and around
Oh, there’s two things that you’re gonna find out
They don't love you and they only love you right now
If I was smarter, I’da stayed my ass at home
And leave them Broadway girls alone 
Them Broadway girls alone 
Leave them Broadway girls alone
They town just told me, "Don't trust 'em"
Broadway girls a trap
They on me, they tryna finesse me
They see me with Morgan and know that I rap
My horse is Porsches, turnin' me on
I jump on a horse, she get on the back
I went to the bar to go buy her a drink
She listen to P!nk, she told me she not into rap
I can't run out of money
The trenches love me forever
They treat me like Ed in London
Take her to pool, then got a beer for nothin'
Tecovas boots, guitar, cigar, the bar
She ridin' a bull like cars, she usually don't cool with stars
Now, there's two things that you're gonna find out
They don't love you and they only love you right now
If I was smarter, I'da stayed my ass at home
And leave them Broadway girls alone
Broadway girls, Broadway girls
Them Broadway girls alone

Oh, think I oughta settle down
And find me somethin' I can take back to my hometown, oh
But I told 'em that I'm savage

They don't love you and they only love you right now

We used to chase that Chattanooga freight
Couple of kids in a Chevrolet
Catch a little air when we cross the tracks
Sipping on something from a paper sack
You hang your shirt on that maple limb
Slipping through the moon to the river bend
Wasn't very long I was jumping in, jumping in
I guess I'm still doing now what I was doing then
Chasin' you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasin' you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasin' that freedom, chasing' that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasin' that you and me, I only see in my rearview
Yeah, I'm laying here tonight holding someone new
Still chasin' you, still chasin' you
You always used to talk about LA
I heard you got as far as Santa Fe
Well you know I tried to track you down
I only got as far as Guitar Town
Singing about a girl I used to know, used to know
Well you should know that I haven't given up
I'm just on your radio
Chasin' you like a shot of whiskey
Burning going down, burning going down
Chasin' you like those goodbye tail lights
Headed west to anywhere out of this nowhere town
Chasin' that freedom, chasin' that feeling that got gone too soon
Chasin' that you and me, I only see in my rearview

>>>Cover Me Up Morgan Wallen

A heart on a run keeps a hand on a gun
I was so sure what I needed was more
Tried to shoot out the sun
The days when we raged, we flew off the page
Such damage was done
But I made it through, 'cause somebody knew
I was meant for someone
So, girl, leave your boots by the bed, we ain't leavin' this room
'Til someone needs medical help or the magnolias bloom
It's cold in this house and I ain't goin' out to chop wood
So, cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good
I put your faith to the test when I tore off your dress
In Richmond on High
I sobered up, I swore off that stuff
And the old lover's sing, “I thought it'd be me
Who helped him get home”
But home was a dream, one that I'd never seen
'Til you came along
So, girl, hang your dress out to dry, we ain't leavin' this room
'Til Percy Priest breaks open wide and the river runs through
And carries this house on its Stones like a piece of driftwood
So, cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good
So, girl, leave your boots by the bed, we ain't leavin' this room
'Til someone needs medical help or the magnolias bloom
It's cold in this house and I ain't goin' out to chop wood
So, cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good
So, cover me up and know you're enough to use me for good

>>>Cowgirls Morgan Wallen

She'll set the field on fire just cuttin' across a pasture
She'll have you fallin' for it all and then leave right after
And she got a cold heart but she got a warm smile
Cut from the same cloth, she kinda buck wild
Little bit angel, whole lotta outlaw
She's trouble but I'll tell you right now, y'all
Never gonna settle on down girls
Leave you in a lonely ghost town world
Where the sun don't rise, rodeo for one night
Love you like a mustang
One hand on thеm giddy-up reins
Hole in your heart with somе good aim
On a goodbye ride but it's fine 'cause it's kinda my thing
Yeah, long live cowgirls
I hate that I love the way them kisses taste like whiskey
How they wake up, take on off, and not even miss me
Leave this heart broken, holdin' that smokin' gun
I guess that's just the way them wild horses run
Never gonna settle on down girls
Leave you in a lonely ghost town world
Where the sun don't rise, rodeo for one night
Love you like a mustang
One hand on them giddy-up reins
Hole in your heart with some good aim
On a goodbye ride but it's fine 'cause it's kinda my thing
Yeah, long live cowgirls
Don't you wanna take me away?
Lay me on down, girl
With the wild kind of lovin' you make
Never gonna settle on down girls
Leave you in a lonely ghost town world

I could see me sittin' in the back of a cop car bangin' my head on a window
I could see me slammin' that last call shot glass, losin' everything in my billfold
That's what I do when I'm drinkin' 'bout you
So, I don't wanna go downtown doin' what we used to
Twist the top off another round, hell I got enough loose screws
I’m gettin' tired of hurtin' 'bout you
I think I'm gonna stay right here tonight
'Cause that could be dangerous
Yeah, I could see me doin' just fine with a Daisy Duke dime but I don't see it lastin' long
I could see me orderin' too many drinks at the bar
Get the bartender pourin' 'em strong
That's what I do when I'm tryna drink you gone
So, I don't wanna go downtown doin' what we used to
Twist the top off another round, hell I got enough loose screws
I’m gettin' tired of hurting 'bout you
I think I'm gonna stay right here tonight
'Cause that could be dangerous
Got somebody else that you've been foolin'
Them same tricks up your sleeve, yeah
I'd usually be the type to be out too
But you ruined that for me, so

Twist the top off another round, hell I got enough loose screws

>>>Don't Think Jesus Morgan Wallen
<sos>
Boy gets a guitar and starts writin' songs
'Bout whiskey and women and gettin' too stoned
He got all three at the first show he played
Hometown said, "I don't think Jesus done it that way"
Boy moves to city, lives fast and goes hard
Starts chasin' the devil through honky-tonk bars
Ignorin' the voices in his head that say
"I don't think Jesus done it this way"
If I was Him I'd say, "To hell with you, ain't no helpin' you"
Find someone else to give Heaven to, I'm tellin' you
I'd shame me, I'd blame me, I'd make me pay for my mistakes
But I don't think Jesus does it that way
Boy's all alone, got no one to turn to
He figures he'll pray, 'cause what else could he do?
He said, "I wish You would've woke me up an easier way"
But I don't think Jesus does it that way
If I was Him I'd say, "To hell with you, ain't no helpin' you"
Find someone else to give Heaven to, I'm tellin' you
I'd shame me, I'd blame me, I'd make me pay for my mistakes
But I don't think Jesus does it that way
World likes to rear back and throw a few stones
So boy wants to throw a few stones of his own
But, Lord knows, I ain't perfect and it ain't my place
And I don't think Jesus done it that way
Are y'all sure that Jesus done it that way?

>>>Everything I Love Morgan Wallen

I wish I woulda met you anywhere but where I did
Some old high-rise town that I won't ever go again
I wish we woulda rolled around in some old cab and chased them city lights
And hit bars I don't like
We were listenin' to "one more silver dollar"
Hangin' out my Silverado down a road I love to ride
Wish I woulda known that by now you'd be good and gone
And you'd leave us in a cloud of dust
Can't you see what you're doin', girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love
I don't care how much they're bitin', I won't even crank the boat
Soon as that bobber hits thе water, girl, your memory starts to float
Baby, why'd l evеr take the bait and take you places that I love to go?
Hell, I'll never know
I even took you to my hometown to meet my mama
Now I'm gonna see you every time I see that welcome sign
Wish I woulda known that by now you'd be good and gone
And you'd leave us in a cloud of dust
Can't you see what you're doin', girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love
I don't wanna hear "one more silver dollar"
I can't take my Silverado down them roads we used to ride
Wish I woulda known that by now you'd be good and gone
And you'd leave us in a cloud of dust
Can't you see what you're doin', girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love
I can't go nowhere near the whiskey 'cause you used to drink it with me
In the bed of my truck and now I can't get drunk
Can't you see what you're doin', girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love
Can't you see what you're doin', girl?
You ruined damn near everything I love

Ah, there's tears in her blue, bloodshot in mine
This bender's been bending, it's hellbound to break
My baby's had all she can take
Mister, I'll take your roses
If you cut off the thorns, she can't take no more
I'll buy violets and daisies to hide all the crazy
It's gonna take all you've got
Ah, it's a bad day for love
But a good day for flower shops
Well, I took some pills and she took the dogs
Ah, it's all gone to hell, she's gone to her mom's
And I took up drinkin' since she took the time
To tell me I took the best years of her life
So buddy, I'll take your roses
If you cut off the thorns, she can't take no more
I'll buy violets and daisies to hide all the crazy
It's gonna take all you got
It's a tough day for love
But a good day for flower shops
Roses are red, violets are blue
I don't need one, I need one million to get you
So mister, I'll take your roses
If you cut off the thorns, she can't take no more

But you won't ever let me catch you
And I wish I was the same
But I know I'm gonna let you
Win again and when I do
It's gonna hurt like hell
And you don't mean to
That's what I tell myself
But why you gotta be so heartless?
I know you think it's harmless
You're tearing me apart and
Girl, the hardest part is
You're so high on attention
Taking miles from inches
Leave me in the darkness
Never finish what we started
Girl, why you gotta be so heartless? 
Why you gotta be so heartless? 
Monday night was definitely not our night
Tuesday night was just another fight
Wednesday, I thought everything would change
Thursday came and it was still the same
Friday night, we went out on the town
Saturday, we should have burned it down
Sunday morning came and now you're gone
I should probably know this shit by now
Ah, oh 
I should probably know this shit by now
But no , no
Why you gotta be so heartless?
I know you think it's harmless
You're tearing me apart and

You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night I kissed your lips
Make you grip the sheets with your fingertips
Last bottle of Jack, we split a fifth
Just talkin' 'bout life, goin' sip for sip
Yeah, you, you know you love to fight
And I say shit I don't mean
But I'm still gon' wake up wantin' you and me

No way it was the last night that we break up
I see your tail lights in the dust
You call your mama, I call your bluff
In the middle of the night, pull it right back up
Yeah, my, my friends say, "Let her go"
Your friends say, "What the hell?"
I wouldn't trade your kind of love for nothin' else
Oh, baby, last night, we let the liquor talk

You told me that you wish I was somebody you never met
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night, we said we'd had enough
I can't remember everything we said, but we said too much
I know you packed your shit and slammed the door right before you left
But, baby, baby, something's tellin' me this ain't over yet
No way it was our last night

Mama don't pray for my success anymore, yeah
But mama still prays for me
Seein' the world ain't really seein' the world
Through a window from A to B
Between alcohol and women and Adderall and adrenaline
I don't ever get no rest
Signed my life away to be the life of the party
Yeah, to everybody else
I look like a rockstar, in and out of cop cars
Livin' out a suitcase, trashin' hotel bars
If I see the sunrise, it's 'cause I stayed up all night
Drinkin' 'cause I need to, damn it, what a good life
Judgin' by my long hair, you might think I don't care
Sittin' here, sippin' and bitchin' about a spot where
Peoplе would kill to be, kill to be, kill to be
But y'all, it ain't as good as it seems, this livin' thе dream is
Killin' me, killin' me, killin' me
It's killin' me, killin' me, killin' me
Another day, another venue
There's trouble to get into
And love ain't on the menu again
Lonely as an eagle
I meet a thousand people
Who think I got a thousand friends
There's a stranger in the mirror
But accordin' to the pictures
I'm a rockstar, in and out of cop cars
Livin' out a suitcase, trashin' hotel bars
If I see the sunrise, it's 'cause I stayed up all night
Drinkin' 'cause I need to, damn it, what a good life
Judgin' by my long hair, you might think I don't care
Sittin' here, sippin' and bitchin' about a spot where
People would kill to be, kill to be, kill to be

Killin' me, killin' me, killin' me

Girl, our mamas are best friends and so are we
The whole town's rooting for us like the home team
Most likely to settle down
Plant a few roots real deep and let 'em grow
But we can't stop this real world from spinnin' us
Your bright lights called, I don't blame you for pickin' up
Your big dream bags are all packed up and ready to go
But I just need you to know
That I love you more than a California sunset
More than a beer when you ain't twenty-one yet
More than a Sunday morning Lord
Turnin' some poor lost souls 'round, and Hallelujah bound
Yeah, I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But, baby, this might be the last time I get to lay you down
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown
I ain't the runaway kind, I can't change that
My heart's stuck in these streets like the train tracks
City sky ain't the same black
Ain't that a map dot shame, man, to think that
I love you more than a California sunset
More than a beer when you ain't twenty-one yet
More than a Sunday morning Lord
Turnin' some poor lost souls around, and Hallelujah bound
Yeah, I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But, baby, this might be the last time I get to lay you down
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown
Yeah, you got a wild in your eyes that I just wasn't born with
I'm a same gas station cup of coffee in the mornin'
I need a house on the hill, girl, not in 'em
So hang onto these words 'til them avenues help you forget 'em
'Cause I love you more than a California sunset
I love you more in a twenty-dollar sundress
Hate that loaded down car you got your keys in
Girl, but I hate even more that you're leavin'
'Cause I love you more than the feeling when the bass hits the hook
When the guy gets the girl at the end of the book
But that ain't you and me so I guess I'll see you around
'Cause I can't love you more than my hometown
Love you more than my hometown
Love you more, baby, love you more

Yeah, but now I'm dodging potholes in my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado, headin' right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissed mе tells me she'd lovе Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots
I said "Let's go shoot tequila"
So we walked back to that beach bar
She said "Don't cowboys drink whiskey?" 
So we drank bottom shelf
She said "Damn, that sky looks perfect"
I said "Girl, you've never seen stars like the ones back home"
And she said "Maybe I should, see 'em for myself"
Yeah, but now I'm dodging potholes in my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado, headin' right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissed me tells me she'd love Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots
I said "Meet me in the mornin'"
And she told me I was crazy
Yeah, but I still thought that maybe she'd show up
Aw, but now I'm dodging potholes in my sunburnt Silverado
Like a heart-broke Desperado, headin' right back to my roots
Somethin' 'bout the way she kissed me tells me she'd love Eastern Tennessee
Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots
Yeah, but all I brought back with me was some sand in my boots

>>>Somebody's Problem Morgan Wallen
<sos>
A 'Bama red 4Runner pulled into the party
With a 30-A sticker on the back windshield
Two-tone tank top slippin' off her shoulder
Kinda girl when she steps out, the world stands still
Ooh, I know where this is goin'
I already know it
She's somebody's problem, somebody's goodbye
Somebody's last call number that they can't find
Somebody's best day, somebody's worst night
Somebody's reason for leavin' on the porch light
Thinkin' 'bout them tan lines and I'm thinkin' damn, I'd
Love to drown in them heartbreaker blue eyes
Shе's somebody's problem and somebody's problеm's
About to be mine
Kinda girl once you've had her, you can't stand to lose her
Kinda girl where your friends tell you don't F it up
Kinda girl that goes from tryin' to just to get her number
To slidin' through the summer to talkin' 'bout love
Ooh, I think I'm likin' where it's goin'
I'd like to try me some of
Somebody's problem, somebody's goodbye
Somebody's last call number that they can't find
Somebody's best day, somebody's worst night
Somebody's reason for leavin' on the porch light
Thinkin' 'bout them tan lines and I'm thinkin' damn, I'd
Love to drown in them heartbreaker blue eyes
She's somebody's problem and somebody's problem's
About to be mine
Oh, hey baby, don't just keep me wishin'
Oh, let me get to fixin'
Somebody's problem, somebody's goodbye
Somebody's last call number that they can't find
Somebody's best day, somebody's worst night
Somebody's reason for leavin' on the porch light
Thinkin' 'bout them tan lines and I'm thinkin' damn, I'd
Love to drown in them heartbreaker blue eyes
She's somebody's problem and somebody's problem's
About to be mine

>>>Stand by Me Morgan Wallen
<sos>
If tomorrow I lost it all
And everything that I have was gone
When there's nobody else to call
Would you stand by me? Would you stand by me?
When the world tries to keep me down 
And there's nobody else around 
Keep it real, can you tell me now? 
Would you stand by me? Would you stand by me? 
I don't know why they be playin' with me
I lose it all, are you stayin' with me?
Amsterdam, I skipped the red district
She love my dawg, but he bad business
I could've been in the bed with you
I decided to hang with some bad bitches
Gave me another chance to prove, but she ain't playin' with me
I'm so sorry for that
Can I explain? Just give me a second
You showed me love and I'll never forget it
Say you don't got it, they think you dramatic
Loyalty, baby, that shit automatic
Brought me to tears, my bro for years
Told me no, say he ain't got it
Ran it up and I ain't panic
Are you gon' ride for me? You don't switch no sides with me 
I need your honesty, no, baby, don't lie to me 
Are you gon' stand ten toes? You supposed to give time to me 
Baby, when shit get real, I need your loyalty
If tomorrow I lost it all
And everything that I have was gone
When there's nobody else to call
Would you stand by me? Would you stand by me?
When the world tries to keep me down 
And there's nobody else around 
Keep it real, can you tell me now? 
Would you stand by me? Would you stand by me? 
What if it all goes south, I get ran out of town
For good this time, would you still wanna
Wanna hold my hand, let me be your man
Let me drive you crazy, are you still gonna
Be somebody I can lean on
Girl, be somebody I can dream on all night
The kind of flame I wanna leave on
If you ain't tryna be that, then be gone
If tomorrow I lost it all
And everything that I have was gone
When there's nobody else to call
Would you stand by me? Would you stand by me?
When the world tries to keep me down 
And there's nobody else around 
Keep it real, can you tell me now? 
Would you stand by me? Would you stand by me? 
Would you stand by me? Would you stand by me? 
Would you stand by me? Would you stand by me? 
Are you gon' ride for me? You don't switch no sides with me

>>>Still Goin' Down Morgan Wallen
<sos>
The way I talk, I guess I got it from my pops
Product of some kneelin' down
In a town where the doors don't lock
And there's a million other people like me
From a scene a little more podunk than pop
I didn't choose being born in the sticks
And I'll be damned if I sound like something I ain't
For some folks, a backroad gets old
But for me, it just can't
'Cause I'm from a small town, southern drawl crowd
We're sippin' clear, drinkin' beer on a Friday night
Every country girl got on her cutoffs
Shakin' her hips, take a trip, buddy tell me I'm a liar
Still circle up big trucks around a fire
Still kickin' up some dust behind the tires
Call it cliché, but hey, just take it from me
It's still goin' down out in the country
Somewhere now, someone's out there
Sippin' on some hundred proof
Every day, a baby's born with some baby blues
A good ol' boy's got on his faded boots
Workin' a nine to five
I'm just another southern hell raiser
Makin' sound for them drop-it-down tailgaters
But y'all, that's all I know to say
So if you think I'm full of it, ain't done it, check the resume
'Cause I'm from a small town, southern drawl crowd
We're sippin' clear, drinkin' beer on a Friday night
Every country girl got on her cutoffs
Shakin' her hips, take a trip, buddy tell me I'm a liar
Still circle up big trucks around a fire
Still kickin' up some dust behind the tires
Call it cliché, but hey, just take it from me
It's still goin' down out in the country
'Cause I'm from a small town, southern drawl crowd
We're sippin' clear, drinkin' beer on a Friday night
Every country girl got on her cutoffs
Shakin' her hips, take a trip, buddy tell me I'm a liar
Still circle up big trucks around a fire
Still kickin' up some dust behind the tires

>>>Thinkin' Bout Me Morgan Wallen

Don't know where you at, don't know where you've been
Don't know nothin' 'bout that boy you're into
Don't feel bad for you but I feel bad for him
And all the hell you gon' be puttin' him through
Probably tell him we're a burnt out flame
Probably tell him that I ain't been on your mind
How I ain't nothin' but a long gone thing
You can cuss my name, but baby, don't you lie
When you're tasting what he's drinking, are you thinkin' 'bout me?
When you're ridin' where he's drivin', are you missin' my street?
Every time you close your eyes, tell me, who do you see?
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Comin' over tonight, wish that truck in your drive was mine
Just like you know it's supposed to be
When you're up in his bed, am I up in your head?
Makin' you crazy, tell me, baby, are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Are you thinkin' 'bout, are you thinkin' 'bout
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Do you hide your phone? Did you change my name?
When he wants to go to our go-to place
Do you tell him you can't? Then go out of your way
To be somewhere, any damn where I ain't
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?
When you're ridin' where he's drivin', are you missin' my street?
Every time you close your eyes, tell me, who do you see?
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Comin' over tonight, wish that truck in your drive was mine

Are you thinkin' 'bout, are you thinkin' 'bout
When you're tastin' what he's drinkin', are you thinkin' 'bout me?
Don't know where you at
But girl, I know where you oughta be

>>>This Bar Morgan Wallen
<sos>
I found myself in this bar
Makin' mistakes and makin’ new friends
I was growin' up and nothin' made sense
Buzzin’ all night like neon in the dark
I found myself in this
Couldn't wait to turn twenty-one
The day I did, I got too drunk
Spinnin' round dizzy on the patio
Found out real quick how to take it slow
Got whiskey bent on whiskey sours
Ran my mouth to an out-of-towner
Learned a big lesson when I met the bouncer
I found myself in this bar
Makin' mistakes and makin' new friends
I was growin' up and nothin' made sense
Buzzin' all night like neon in the dark
I found myself in this bar
I found myself in this
Saw her in the corner sippin’ somethin’ tall
Cracked a few jokes, we hit it off
Year down the road, I'm watchin’ her
Walk through the door with some new jerk
And we had it good, and it hurt so bad
But I had to stand my ground
Chase my pride with another round
I found myself in this bar
Makin' mistakes and makin' new friends
I was growin' up and nothin’ made sense
Learnin' how to live with a broken heart
I found myself in this bar
Those nights, what I would give for one more
Bud Lights and kissin' on the front porch
Didn't even know what I was lookin' for
But I found myself in this bar
I found myself in this bar
Ain't it strange the things you keep tucked in your heart?
I found myself in this bar

Been chasin' songs and women, makin' some bad decisions
God knows I'm drinkin' too much

She lets me fish whenever I want to
Yeah, I'm still proud of where I came from, still your only damn son, can you believe I'm on the radio?
Just thought you should know, thought you should know, thought you should know
Oh, by the way, Mama, didn't mean to ramblе on ya

>>>Up Down Morgan Wallen

It's Friday after 5, got here just in time
Went ahead and wet a line 'fore I went and lost my mind
I ain't been here long, but the bobber's in the pond
Going up down, up, down, up, down
Tonight, we're gonna raise a whole lot more than cane
'Cause there's money in the bank and tomorrow's Saturday
So if they pass that fifth of Jack this way
I turn it up, down, up, down, up, down
We just holding it down here in BFE
Still rolling around with a burnt CD
Free Bird, five minutes deep
Head bobbing up, down, up, down, up, down
We got what we got, we don't need the rest
Can turn this parking lot into a party
With an ice chest, dancing, cold beer
Man, we live it up, down, up, down
We live it up down...here
What you know about it, T-Hubb?
Yeah, the girls, they hit the spot, even hotter when it's hot
If you can't buy her a yacht, but still proud of what you got
'Cause when the day's done, red neck is from the sun
Going up, down, up, down, up, down
We just holding it down here in BFE
Still rolling around with a burnt CD
Free Bird, five minutes deep
Head bobbing up, down, up, down, up, down
We got what we got, we don't need the rest

Hangin' outside that bar
Should've said, "Go home
If you know what's good for your heart"
Should've said, "Watch out
Or boy you're gonna wind up hurt"
And that label on that whiskey on that shelf
Should've said, "Don't buy no shots for no one else"
Should've come with a warnin' 
Don't sit right there, don't sip on what they're pourin' 
Her kiss is gonna kill you in the mornin'
Nah, it ain't gonna end too good
Everythin' about that night I thought I wanted
Should've come with a warnin' 
Should've come with a warnin'
Phone just lit up
And it's damn near 2 AM
Oughta be blue lights, or some kind of loud sirens
Sayin', "Don't pick it up, she'll let you down"
It's the deep end and you're gonna drown
And this "You up?" text that she sent me right now
Should've come with a warnin' 
Don't sit right there, don't sip on what they're pourin' 
Her kiss is gonna kill you in the mornin'
Nah, it ain't gonna end too good
Everything about that night I thought I wanted
Should've come with a warnin' 
Should've come with a warnin'
Don't fire it up, and hit the headlights
Turn on around at the next red light
I wish somebody would've gave me some damn signs
Yeah, I wish that night
Would've come with a warnin' 
Would've come with a warnin'
Would've come with a warnin'

Your memory gets to burnin', lean back on the bourbon
Sure as hell can't keep leanin' on you
Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again
It's all my fault, yeah, I dropped the ball
You're gone and I'm gone three sheets to the wind
I've wasted on you
All of this time and all of this money
All of the these sorries I don't owe you honey
All of these miles on this Chevy, and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent wasted on you
Yeah, I swore this one'd be different, my heart wouldn't listen
To my head and these boots on my feet
Looks like I'm learnin' the hard way again
That's why I've been
All of this time and all of this money
All these sorries I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent wasted on you
Like this pile of your stuff that's packed up in a bag
Right down to the flame of this match
Wasted on you, wasted on you
All of this time and all of this money
All these sorries I don't owe you, honey
All of these miles on this Chevy and prayers in a pew
All them days I spent wasted on you
Wasted on you, wasted on you

>>>The Way I Talk Morgan Wallen
<sos>
It's got a touch of the town where I grew up
Something in it them California girls love
Some people like to make a little fun of
The way I talk
It gets slower after three or four cold beers
And gets louder when I'm cheerin' on the Volunteers
Folks know I'm country, when they hear
The way I talk
It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No, I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi roads
It's the only way I know
Man it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk
Yeah it's, "Yes sir, no ma'am, y'all come back, now"
Fightin' words if you run my last name down
I ain't ashamed, matter of fact I'm damn proud
Of the way I talk, y'all
It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No, I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi roads
It's the only way I know
Man it ain't my fault
I just live the way I talk
Slow, like a Sunday morning service back home
And kinda sweet when I got a girl to love on
If you know me, you know
It sounds a little bit like my daddy
It don't cuss around my mama
Got some words you've never heard
'Less you come from down yonder
The man upstairs gets it
So I ain't tryna fix it
No I can't hide it
I don't fight it, I just roll with it
Oh, kinda slow like the Mississippi roads
It's the only way I know
Man it ain't my fault

Politicians lie, been fired by the boss
It takes one hand
To count the things I can count on
No, there ain't much, man
That ain't never let me down
Longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me that bars and this guitar
And longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart
She was a Carolina blue jean baby
Fire in her eyes that drove me crazy
It was red taillights when she left town
If I didn't know then, I sure know now
But longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me that bars and this guitar
And longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart, yeah
Well, it takes one hand
To count the things I can count on
But I got one hand
That's grippin' down on a cold one
'Cause longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart
Like diamond rings and football teams have torn this boy apart
Like a neon dream, it just dawned on me, that bars, and this guitar
And longneck ice-cold beer never broke my heart, no
It never broke my heart

A 40 HP Johnson on a flat bottom metal boat
Coke cans and BB guns, barbed wire and old fence posts
8-point bucks in autumn and freshly cut cornfields
One arm out the window and one hand on the wheel
Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here
Your license in my wallet when we go out downtown
Your lipstick's stained every coffee cup that I got in this house
The way you say, "I love you, too" is like rain on an old tin roof
And your hand fits right into mine like a needle in a groove
Some things just go better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here
Sometimes we're oil and water
But I wouldn't have it any other way
And if I'm being honest
Your first and my last name
Would just sound better together and probably always will
Like a cup of coffee and a sunrise, Sunday drives and time to kill
What's the point of this ol' guitar if it ain't got no strings?
Or pourin' your heart into a song that you ain't gonna sing?
It's a match made up in heaven, like good ol' boys and beer
And me, as long as you're right here
And me, as long as you're right here

A gravel Iot chock full o' toolbox trucks
Makin' their happy hour way home
When guys like me lose girls like you
They got "Whiskey River" on the jukebox
A honky tonk sawdust dance floor
A neon, five o'clock, pro clock
And plenty damn many when you want one more
This broke-heart fool on an old bar stool
Drinkin' beer almost as cold as you
Bunch of good time numbers on the stall door
A picture o' you on the dart board
Them cinder block walls ain't ever been cleaned
Still ain't as dirty as you done me

'Bout to kick off the weekend
There's a stretch of blacktop
I ain't never seen a cop
So, I'm pushing it a little past ten
Pulled a little money from the bank, put it in the tank
Shined up the windshield glass
Don't know where the night might lead, ain't nowhere to be
But I gotta get there fast
There's a cold beer calling my name
Feel a good time coming, got a new song humming
And the sunset's doing its thing
Feeling lucky as a seven
Is a pocket full of payday green
And my baby putting sugar on me
Yeah, it's sure been a pretty damn good day
And there's a cold beer calling my name, yeah
If there's a hillbilly rock show
I'll be in the front row
Holding up a red Bic flame
Or a wraparound porch with a citronella torch
Yeah, you know I'm down either way
There's a chance that tonight might be
A night that we
Ain't ever gonna forget
Yeah, everybody's turning it up, I got a little buzz
And I ain't even had one yet
There's a cold beer calling my name
Feel a good time coming, got a new song humming
And the sunset's doing its thing 
Feeling lucky as a seven
Is a pocket full of payday green
And my baby putting sugar on me
Yeah, it's sure been a pretty damn good day
And there's a cold beer calling my name
It's calling my name
Yeah, there's a cold beer calling my name
Oh, yeah it is
Yeah, I'm gonna put a little chill in my weekend
Stay up all night, maybe sleep in
I'm gonna sip a little something
And I ain't gotta worry 'bout nothing, 'cause

Cold beer calling my name

>>>Does to Me Luke Combs
<sos>
I was a third-string dreamer on a second-place team
But I was hell on wheels with a full head of steam
When coach put me in
And I'm still proud of that hit
I was a last resort to go to prom with the queen
Thanks to an ex-boyfriend who broke her heart that week
No, I didn't get lucky
But I still felt like a king
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me
I was the one phone call when my brother went to jail
Pawned my guitar just to pay his bail
No, I'll never get it back
But I'm okay with that
I was the first man standing next to my best friend
The day the love of his life said "I do" to him
I was a couple beers deep
But I still remembered that speech
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me
There's a worn-out blade that my granddaddy gave me
My mama's first Bible, Daddy's Don Williams vinyl
That first-fish-catching Zebco thirty-three
Well, that might not mean much to you
But it does to me
So say I'm a middle of the road
Not much to show
Underachieving average Joe 
But I'm a hell of a lover
A damn good brother
And I wear this heart on my sleeve
And I'm a damn hard working
One thing's for certain
I stand up for what I believe 
That might not mean much to you
But it does to me
Yeah, it does to me
And that might not mean much to you
But it does to me
Oh, it does to me
Oh man, it does to me

>>>Doin' This Luke Combs

Someone asked me once in an interview
"What was growing up like?"
"Where'd you go to school?"
"And what would you do if you weren't doin' this?"
I'd be drivin' my first car, an old worn-out Dodge
Tryin' to make rent with a dead-end job, just makin' due
With tips in a jar, my guitar, and an old barstool
I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand
Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band
Singin' them same damn songs like I am now
I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage
Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins
At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town
I'd still be doin' this if I weren't doin' this
I'd still be the same guy they knew back in the day
Who was burnin' CD's just to give away
If I wasn't doin' this
Five deep in a van, head full of steam
Hot on the heels of my neon dreams maybe comin' true
Livin' this life just like I was born to do
I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand
Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band
Singin' them same damn songs like I am now
I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage
Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins
At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town
I'd still be doin' this if I weren't doin' this
It ain't about the fame
It ain't about the fortune
It ain't about the name
It ain't about the glory
I guess I'm sayin' it's always been about
I'd have a Friday night crowd in the palm of my hand
Cup of brown liquor, couple buddies in a band
Singin' them same damn songs like I am now
I'd be feelin' on fire on a hardwood stage
Bright lights like lightning runnin' through my veins
At the Grand Ole Opry or a show in some no-name town
I'd still be doin' this if I weren't doin' this

"What was growing up like?"
"Where'd you go to school?"

>>>Even Though I'm Leaving Luke Combs

Daddy, I'm afraid, won't you stay a little while?
Keep me safe 'cause there's monsters right outside
Daddy, please don't go, I don't wanna be alone
'Cause the second that you're gone they're gonna know
Before he went to bed he grabbed my hand and said
Just 'cause I'm leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, I know you're scared when I'm not here
But I'll always be right there
Even though I'm leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere
Dad, we'll be late, and Uncle Sam don't like to wait
He's got a big old plane that's gonna take me far away
I know I act tough, but there's a churnin' in my gut
'Cause I just can't call you up when things get rough
Before I left, he hugged my neck and said
Just 'cause you're leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, I know you're scared I might be here
But I'll always be right there
Even though you're leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere
Daddy, I'm afraid, won't you stay a little while?
I never thought I'd see the day I had to say goodbye
Daddy, please don't go, I can't do this on my own
There's no way that I can walk this road alone
Daddy grabbed my hand and said
Just 'cause I'm leavin'
It don't mean that I won't be right by your side
When you need me
And you can't see me in the middle of the night
Just close your eyes and say a prayer
It's okay, boy, I ain't scared
I won't be here, but I'll always be right there
Even though I'm leavin', I ain't goin' nowhere

>>>Fast Car Luke Combs
<sos>
You got a fast car
And I want a ticket to anywhere
Maybe we make a deal
Maybe together we can get somewhere
Any place is better
Startin' from zero, got nothin' to lose
Maybe we'll make something
Me, myself, I got nothin' to prove
You got a fast car
And I got a plan to get us out of here
I've been workin' at the convenience store
Managed to save just a little bit of money
Won't have to drive too far
Just across thе border and into the city
And you and I can both get jobs
Finally see what it mеans to be livin'
See, my old man's got a problem
He live in the bottle, that's the way it is
He said his body's too old for working
His body's too young to look like his
So Mama went off and left him
She wanted more from life than he could give
I said, "Somebody's gotta take care of him"
So I quit school and that's what I did
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Still gotta make a decision
Leave tonight or live and die this way
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
You got a fast car
We go cruising, entertain ourselves
You still ain't got a job
So I work in the market as a checkout girl
I know things will get better
You'll find work and I'll get promoted
And we'll move out of the shelter
Buy a bigger house, live in the suburbs
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
You got a fast car
I got a job that pays all our bills
You stay out drinking late at the bar
See more of your friends than you do your kids
I'd always hoped for better
Thought maybe together you and me would find it
I got no plans, I ain't goin' nowhere
Take your fast car and keep on driving
So I remember when we were driving, driving in your car
Speed so fast, I felt like I was drunk
City lights lay out before us and your arm felt nice wrapped around my shoulder
And I had a feeling that I belonged
I had a feeling I could be someone, be someone, be someone
You got a fast car
Is it fast enough so we can fly away?
Still gotta make a decision

A cold beer's got twelve ounces
A good truck's got maybe three hundred thousand
You only get so much until it's gone
Duracells in a Maglite
A needle drop on a forty-five
Are the kinda things that only last so long
When the new wears off, and they get to gettin' old
Sooner or later, time's gonna take its toll
They say nothing lasts forever
But they ain't seen us together
Or the way the moonlight dances in your eyes
Just a T-shirt in the kitchen
With no make-up and a million
Other things that I could look at my whole life
A love like that makes a man have second thoughts
Maybe some things last forever after all
The FM station on the outskirts
Blue jeans after years of shift work
All fadin' out like I always knew they would
The strings on this guitar
The first love lost on a young heart
Those things are gonna break after the getting's good
'Cause the new wears off and they get to gettin' old

You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane
Knew it was gonna be a long night
From the moment when
We locked eyes over whiskey on ice
Started talkin' 'bout us again
If I woulda just laid my drink down
I wouldn't be in my truck
Driving us to your house
But you rolled in with your hair in the wind
I was doin' alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin’
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain' was drivin’, thunder, lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came
And hit me like a hurricane
You hit me like a hurricane
And girl it ain't but midnight
You done killed the lights
Bent my heart back to your bedside
Then you rolled in with your hair in the wind
I was doing alright but just your sight
Had my heart stormin'
The moon went hidin’, stars quit shinin’
Rain was drivin’, thunder n' lightning
You wrecked my whole world when you came

So I've been thinkin' we need

Let's get some candles burning
And some records turning
All the lights down low
Take it nice and slow
The way your body's moving
Keep doing what you're doing to me all night long
Writin' our love song
Girl, I want it, gotta have it
Let the passion take us to a higher place
Makin' the kind of love we make
There ain't no way, baby
To get me out this house
When you look this good
What could I even think about? Oh, oh
Besides turn around and lockin' the door
Watching your red dress fall to the floor
Let's get some candles burning
And some records turning

Take it nice and slow

>>>Love You Anyway Luke Combs

If your kiss turned me to stone
I'd be a statue standing tall in ancient Rome
And if your touch shattered me like glass
I’d be in pieces trying to make the breaking last
If it took one look to turn my days to night
At least I'd have the stars that sparkle in your eyes
There's just some things that leave a man no choice
Like a compass needle needing its true North
Even if I knew the day we met you’d be the reason this heart breaks
Oh, I'd love you anyway
I know just tryin' to write a song
I run the risk that I could get your perfect wrong
And well, I guess what I'm tryin' to say
Is there ain't words been made could shoulder so much weight
And if you turned your back on me and walked away
Not a thing about the way I feel would change
There's just some things that leave a man no choice
Like a compass needle needing its true North
Even if I knew the day we met you'd be the reason this heart breaks
Oh, I’d love you anyway

>>>Lovin' on You Luke Combs
<sos>
Don't get me wrong
I like a bobber on the water
Hookin' 'em and reelin' 'em in
I like a Friday night slow ride
Brooks & Dunn B-side
Hit rewind, spin it again
I like a strong shot of whiskey
The way a Marlboro hits me
Some broken in cowboy boots
But I'm in love and lovin' on you
I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room
I can't get enough of you, honey
You're right on the money
I'm a junkie for your midnight moves
I'm in love and lovin' on you
I like a sunrise, duck blind
Birdie on a par 5
Miller Lite before noon
I like a two-door old Ford
Wood board back porch
Three chords and the truth
But I'm in love and lovin' on you
I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room
I can't get enough of you, honey
You're right on the money
I'm a junkie for your midnight moves
I'm in love with lovin' on you
Girl, I'm in love and lovin' on you
I feel that rush soon as you walk in a room
I can't get enough of you, honey
You're right on the money
I'm a junkie for your midnight moves
I'm in love and lovin' on you
I'm in love and lovin' on you

>>>One Number Away Luke Combs
<sos>
Are you sitting at home, all alone, trying to fall asleep?
Are you staring a hole through your phone, praying that it rings?
Are you watching a movie that you've seen a thousand times?
Or maybe playing some Mayer, getting lost in your favorite lines
Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes
To drown out the noise
But I just wanna hear your voice
I’m one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
I lied when I said
"I'm leaving and not coming back"
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away
Are you stuck at a red light with a Marlboro Light on your lips?
Does the smoke in your mirror get clearer without my kiss?
Are you changing the station replacing our favorite songs?
Well maybe it's a mistake, hit the brakes on the moving on
Well, if you're anything like me
You just might be doing whatever it takes
To outrun the storm
But I'm almost out that door
And I'm one number away
From calling to you
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
I lied when I said
"I'm leaving and not coming back"
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away
Will you pick up when I call?
Or just forget we loved at all
We don't have to talk
I just wanna hear your voice
And I'm one number away
I said I was through
But I'm dying, inside
Got my head in a mess
I lied when I said
"I'm leaving and not coming back"
Might be the whiskey or the midnight rain
But everywhere I go, I see your face
In my brain, dial it up, everything I wanna say
But I'm still one number away
Yeah I'm still one number away

>>>She Got the Best of Me Luke Combs
<sos>
Seventeen, you don't think that much about life
You just live it
Like kerosene dancing around a fire
But you're in it
So you jump right in
Ain't afraid to fall
And you give it all
She got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beating in this guitar
Every night, a different town
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
Yeah, you get what's left of me
'Cause she got the best of me
I picked myself up off the floor
And found something new worth living for
And a old dusty hand-me-down six-string
And a couple chords
I'm getting over her
A little more with every song
So y'all sing along
She got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beating in this guitar
Every night, a different town
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
Yeah, you get what's left of me
'Cause she got the best of me
She got the best of me
She broke my heart
Now all that's left of me
Is beating in this guitar
Every night, a different town
She follows me around
So you get what's left of me
Yeah, you get what's left of me
'Cause she got the best of me

>>>Six Feet Apart Luke Combs
<sos>
When the dogwoods start to bloom
And the crickets hum their tune
That's usually about the time
But the news has all been bad
And the whole world seems so sad
I ain't had much else going on
So I sat down and wrote this song
I miss my mom, I miss my dad
Miss the road, I miss my band
Giving hugs and shaking hands
It's a mystery, I suppose
Just how long this thing goes
But there'll be crowds and there'll be shows
And there will be light after dark
Some day when we aren't six feet apart
First thing that I'm gonna do
Slide on in some corner booth
And take the whole damn family out
Buy my buddies all a round
Pay some extra on the tab
Catch a movie, catch a cab
Watch a ball game from the stands
Probably over-wash my hands
I miss my mom, I miss my dad
Miss the road, I miss my band
Giving hugs and shaking hands
Well, it's a mystery, I suppose
Just how long this thing goes
But there'll be crowds and there'll be shows
And there will be light after dark
Some day when we aren't six feet apart
I miss my mom, I miss my dad
I miss the road, I miss my band
Giving hugs and shaking hands
Well, it's a mystery, I suppose
Just how long this thing goes
But there'll be crowds and there'll be shows
And there will be light after dark
Some day when we aren't six feet apart
There will be light after dark
Some day when we aren't six feet apart

>>>When It Rains It Pours Luke Combs
<sos>
Man, she woke up fightin' mad
Bitchin' and moanin' on and on
'Bout the time I had
And by Tuesday you could say
That girl was good as gone
Then when Thursday came around I was all alone
So I went for a drive to clear my mind
Ended up at a Shell on I-65
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
I bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day, three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
Now she was sure real quick to up and apologize
When she heard about my newfound luck
On that FM dial
And it's crazy how lately now
It just seems to come in waves
What I thought was gonna be the death of me
Was my saving grace
It's got me thinking that her leaving
Is the only logical reason
That I got the last spot in the Hooters' parking lot
And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart
She picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call
And I only spent five bucks at the Moose Club raffle
Won a used 4-wheeler and three free passes
For me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf
And I ain't gotta see my
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours
Well I've been on one hell of a redneck roll
For three weeks now
And it all started on the day that she walked out
Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch-off ticket
Bought two 12-packs and a tank of gas with it
She swore they were a waste of time
Oh, but she was wrong
And I was caller number five on a radio station
Won a four day, three night beach vacation
Deep sea señorita fishing down in Panama
And I ain't gotta see my
Oh Lord, when it rains it pours
When it rains it pours

>>>Without You Luke Combs
<sos>
Dad sold every record he ever owned
Floyd and Zeppelin, Beatles, Stones
A lifetime of music gone just to get me through
Momma always had her a second job
Gone with the sun until six o’clock
Whatever it took to get by she was gonna do
Didn’t dawn on me back then but now I see
Without them, I wouldn’t be me
When I’m up here on this stage
The spotlight’s on my face
But I see you
Sure it’s me behind this mic stand
It’s me strumming this Gibson
It’s me they love to give the credit to
But me don’t mean a thing without you
You make sacrifices every night and day
Never hear the crowd scream your name
But there’s a smile and a hand to hold when the show is through
I’d give it all up just to keep your love
But you wouldn’t let me because you care too much
About watching me watch my dreams all come true
When I’m up here on this stage
The spotlight’s on my face
But I see you
Sure it’s me behind this mic stand
It’s me strumming this Gibson
It’s me they love to give the credit to
But me don’t mean a thing without you
You worked overtime to buy those tickets
The gas, the beer and the babysitters
Just to spend one night with your baby at a country show
Paid twenty damn dollars for a place to park
Got in line early to grab your spot
So you deserve every word, every line of your favorite tune
When I’m up here on this stage
The spotlight’s on my face
But I see you
Sure it’s me behind this mic stand
It’s me strumming this Gibson
It’s me they love to give the credit to
I’m just trying to give the credit where credit’s due
Because me don’t mean a thing without you

I found a guy, told me I was a star
He held the door, held my hand in the dark
And he's perfect on paper, but he's lying to my face
Does he think that I'm the kinda girl who needs to be saved?
And there's one more boy, he's from my past
We fell in love, but it didn't last
'Cause the second I figure it out, he pushes me away
And I won't fight for love if you won't meet me halfway
And I say that I'm through, but this song's still for you
All I want is love that lasts
Is all I want too much to ask?
Is it something wrong with me?
All I want is a good guy
Are my expectations far too high?
Try my best, but what can I say?
All I have is myself at the end of the day
But shouldn't that be enough for me?
And I miss the days when I was young and naive
I thought the perfect guy would come and find me
Now happy ever after, it don't come so easily
All I want is love that lasts
Is all I want too much to ask?
Is it something wrong with me? Oh, ooh
All I want is a good guy
Are my expectations far too high?
Try my best but what can I say?
All I have is myself at the end of the day
And all I want is for that to be okay

>>>All-American Bitch Olivia Rodrigo

I am light as a feather, I'm as stiff as a board
I pay attention to things that most people ignore
And I'm alright with the movies
That make jokes 'bout senseless cruelty, that's for sure
And I am built like a mother and a total machine
I feel for your every little issue, I know just what you mean
And I make light of the darkness
I've got sun in my motherfuckin' pocket, best believe
Yeah, you know me, I
Forgive and I forget
I know my age, and I act like it
Got what you can't resist
I'm a perfect all-American
I am light as a feather, I'm as fresh as the air
Coca-Cola bottles that I only use to curl my hair
I got class and integrity
Just like a goddamn Kennedy, I swear
With love to spare, I
Forgive and I forget
I know my age, and I act like it
Got what you can't resist
I'm a perfect all-American bitch
With perfect all-American lips
And perfect all-American hips
I know my place
I know my place and this is it
I don't get angry when I'm pissed
I'm the eternal optimist
I scream inside to deal with it, like, "Ah"
Like, "Ah" 
I'm grateful all the time
I'm sexy and I'm kind
I'm pretty when I cry
Oh, all the time
I'm grateful all the time 
I'm sexy and I'm kind

>>>Bad Idea Right? Olivia Rodrigo
<sos>
Haven't heard from you in a couple of months
But I'm out right now and I'm all fucked up
And you're callin' my phone and you're all alone
And I'm sensing some undertone
And I'm right here with all my friends
But you're sending me your new address
And I know we're done, I know we're through
But, God, when I look at you
My brain goes, "Ah"
Can't hear my thoughts 
Like blah-blah-blah 
I should probably, probably not
It's a bad idea, right?
Fuck it, it's fine
Yes, I know that he's my ex
But can't two people reconnect?
I only see him as a friend
The biggest lie I ever said
Oh, yes, I know that he's my ex
But can't two people reconnect?
I only see him as a friend
I just tripped and fell into his bed
Now I'm gettin' in the car, wreckin' all my plans
I know I should stop, but I can't
And I told my friends I was asleep
But I never said where or in whose sheets
And I pull up to your place on the second floor
And you're standing, smiling at the door
And I'm sure I've seen much hotter men
But I really can't remember when
My brain goes, "Ah"
Can't hear my thoughts 
Like blah-blah-blah 
I should probably, probably not

I want it to be, like, messy
I'm so insecure, I think
That I'll die before I drink
And I'm so caught up in the news
Of who likes me and who hates you
And I'm so tired that I might
Quit my job, start a new life
And they'd all be so disappointed
'Cause who am I if not exploited?
And I'm so sick of seventeen
Where's my fucking teenage dream?
If someone tells me one more time
"Enjoy your youth," I'm gonna cry
And I don't stick up for myself
I'm anxious, and nothing can help
And I wish I'd done this before
And I wish people liked me more
All I did was try my best
This the kinda thanks I get?
They say these are the golden years
But I wish I could disappear
Ego crush is so severe
God, it's brutal out here
I feel like no one wants me
And I hate the way I'm perceived
I only have two real friends
And lately, I'm a nervous wreck
'Cause I love people I don't like
And I hate every song I write
And I'm not cool, and I'm not smart
And I can't even parallel park
All I did was try my best
This the kinda thanks I get?
They say these are the golden years
But I wish I could disappear
Ego crush is so severe
God, it's brutal out here
Got a broken ego, broken heart
And God, I don't even know where to start

Car rides to Malibu
Strawberry ice cream, one spoon for two
Laughin’ 'bout how small it looks on you
Watching reruns of Glee
Bein' annoying, singin’ in harmony
I bet she's braggin' to all her friends, sayin' you're so unique, hmm
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it's all reused
That was our place, I found it first
I made the jokes you tell to her when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she’s with you?
Do you get déjà vu?  Hmm
Do you get déjà vu, huh?
Do you call her, almost say my name?
’Cause let's be honest, we kinda do sound the same
I hate to think that I was just your type
And I bet that she knows Billy Joel
’Cause you played her "Uptown Girl"
You're singin' it together
Now I bet you even tell her how you love her
In between the chorus and the verse 
So when you gonna tell her that we did that, too?
She thinks it's special, but it’s all reused
That was the show we talked about
Played you the songs she's singing now when she's with you
Do you get déjà vu when she's with you?
Do you get déjà vu? 
Do you get déjà vu?
Strawberry ice cream in Malibu
Don't act like we didn't do that shit, too
You're tradin' jackets like we used to do
Play her piano, but she doesn't know 
That I was the one who taught you Billy Joel 
A different girl now, but there's nothing new

>>>Drivers License Olivia Rodrigo

I got my driver's license last week
Just like we always talked about
'Cause you were so excited for me
To finally drive up to your house
But today, I drove through the suburbs
Crying 'cause you weren't around
And you're probably with that blonde girl
She's so much older than me
She's everything I'm insecure about
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
'Cause how could I ever love someone else?
And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
And all my friends are tired
Of hearing how much I miss you, but
I kinda feel sorry for them
'Cause they'll never know you the way that I do
Yeah, today, I drove through the suburbs
And pictured I was driving home to you
And I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one, oh
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
I guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
Red lights, stop signs
I still see your face in the white cars, front yards
Can't drive past the places we used to go to
'Cause I still fuckin' love you, babe 
I still hear your voice in the traffic, we're laughing
Over all the noise
God, I'm so blue, know we're through
But I still fuckin' love you, babe 
I know we weren't perfect, but I've never felt this way for no one
And I just can't imagine how you could be so okay now that I'm gone
Guess you didn't mean what you wrote in that song about me
'Cause you said forever, now I drive alone past your street
Yeah, you said forever, now I drive alone past your street

And I watched as you fled the scene
Doe-eyed as you buried me
One heart broke, four hands bloody
The things I did
Just so I could call you mine
The things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime
You used me as an alibi
I crossed my heart as you crossed the line
And I defended you to all my friends
And now every time a siren sounds
I wondеr if you're around
'Cause you know that I'd do it all again
All the things I did
Just so I could call you minе
The things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime
It's bittersweet to think about the damage that we'd do
'Cause I was goin' down, but I was doin' it with you
Yeah, everything we broke and all the trouble that we made
But I say that I hate you with a smile on my face
Oh, look what we became
All the things I did
Just so I could call you mine
All the things you did
Well, I hope I was your favorite crime

>>>Get Him Back! Olivia Rodrigo

Wait, is this the song with the drums?
I met a guy in the summer and I left him in the spring
He argued with me about everything
He had an ego and a temper and a wandering eye
He said he's 6'2 and I'm, like, "Dude, nice try"
But he was so much fun and he had such weird friends
And he would take us out to parties and the night would never end
Another song, another club, another bar, another dance
And when hе said something wrong, he'd just fly me to Francе
So I miss him some nights when I'm feeling depressed
'Til I remember every time he made a pass on my friend
Do I love him? Do I hate him? I guess it's up and down
If I had to choose, I would say right now
I wanna get him back
I wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad
Oh, I wanna get him back
'Cause then again, I really miss him and it makes me real sad
Oh, I want sweet revenge and I want him again
I want to get him back, back, back
So I write him all these letters and I throw them in the trash
'Cause I miss the way he kisses and the way he made me laugh
Yeah, I pour my little heart out, but as I'm hitting "send"
I picture all the faces of my disappointed friends
Because everyone knew all of the shit that he'd do
He said I was the only girl, but that just wasn't the truth
And when I told him how he hurt me, he'd tell me I was trippin'
But I am my father's daughter, so maybe I could fix him
I wanna get him back
I wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad
Oh, I wanna get him back
'Cause then again, I really miss him and it makes me real sad
Oh, I want sweet revenge and I want him again
I want to get him back 
I want to get him back, back, back
I wanna key his car 
I wanna make him lunch 
I wanna break his heart 
Then be the one to stitch it up 
Wanna kiss his face 
With an uppercut 
I wanna meet his mom 
Just to tell her her son sucks 
Oh, I wanna key his car, I wanna make him lunch 
I wanna break his heart, stitch it right back up 
I wanna kiss his face with an uppercut 
I wanna meet his mom and tell her her son sucks, yeah 
I wanna get him back
I wanna make him really jealous, wanna make him feel bad
Oh, I wanna get him back
'Cause then again, I really miss him and it makes me real sad
Oh, I want sweet revenge and I want him again
I want to get him back 
I want to get him back, back, back
I'll get him, I'll get him, I'll get him, I'll get him back 
Get him back 
I'm gonna get him so good, he's not even gonna know what hit him
He's gonna love me and hate me at the same time
Oh, I don't know, I got him good, I got him really good

Remember when you said that you wanted to give me the world?
And good for you, I guess that you've been workin' on yourself
I guess that therapist I found for you, she really helped
Now you can be a better man for your brand-new girl 
Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you
Well, good for you, I guess you're gettin' everything you want 
You bought a new car and your career's really takin' off 
It's like we never even happened
Baby, what the fuck is up with that? 
And good for you, it's like you never even met me
Remember when you swore to God I was the only
Person who ever got you? Well, screw that, and screw you
You will never have to hurt the way you know that I do
Well, good for you

You're doin' great out there without me, baby
God, I wish that I could do that
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you
Maybe I'm too emotional
But your apathy's like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
Maybe I'm too emotional
Your apathy is like a wound in salt
Maybe I'm too emotional
Or maybe you never cared at all
Well, good for you
You look happy and healthy, not me
If you ever cared to ask
You're doin' great out there without me, baby
Like a damn sociopath
I've lost my mind, I've spent the night
Cryin' on the floor of my bathroom
But you're so unaffected, I really don't get it
But I guess good for you
Well, good for you, I guess you moved on really easily

>>>Happier Olivia Rodrigo

We broke up a month ago
Your friends are mine, you know I know
You've moved on, found someone new
One more girl who brings out the better in you
And I thought my heart was detached
From all the sunlight of our past
But she's so sweet, she's so pretty
Does she mean you forgot about me?
Oh, I hope you're happy
But not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
So find someone great, but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier
And do you tell her she's the most beautiful girl you've ever seen?
An eternal love bullshit you know you'll never mean
Remember when I believed
You meant it when you said it first to me?
And now I'm pickin' her apart
Like cuttin' her down will make you miss my wretched heart
But she's beautiful, she looks kind
She probably gives you butterflies
I hope you're happy
But not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, I can't let you go
So find someone great, but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy
I wish you all the best, really
Say you love her, baby, just not like you loved me
And think of me fondly when your hands are on her
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier
I hope you're happy
Just not like how you were with me
I'm selfish, I know, can't let you go
So find someone great, but don't find no one better
I hope you're happy, but don't be happier

>>>1 Step Forward, 3 Steps Back Olivia Rodrigo
<sos>
Called you on the phone today
Just to ask you how you were
All I did was speak normally
Somehow, I still struck a nerve
You got me fucked up in the head, boy
Never doubted myself so much
Like, am I pretty? Am I fun, boy?
I hate that I give you power over that kinda stuff
'Cause it's always one step forward and three steps back
I'm the love of your life until I make you mad
It's always one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me?
Boy, I don't understand
No, I don't understand
And maybe in some masochistic way
I kind of find it all exciting
Like, which lover will I get today?
Will you walk me to the door or send me home crying?
It's one step forward and three steps back
I'm the love of your life until I make you mad
It's always one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me?
Boy, I don't understand
No, it's back and forth, did I say something wrong?
It's back and forth, going over everything I said
It's back and forth, did I do something wrong?
It's back and forth, maybe this is all your fault instead
It's one step forward and three steps back
And I'd leave you, but the rollercoaster's all I've ever had
Yeah, it's one step forward and three steps back
Do you love me, want me, hate me?
Boy, I don't understand
No, I don't understand

All my life, I've seen myself through your eyes
Wonderin' if I am good enough for your time
You love me but for all the wrong reasons
Am I somethin' to you and not someone?
'Cause I feel trapped on this pedestal you put me on
You tell me that I'm beautiful, but I think that's an understatement
'Cause I am more than what I am to you
You say I'm perfect, but I've got thorns with my petals too
And I won't be confined to your point of view
I'm breakin' through the glass you put me in
'Cause my beauty's from within
My beauty's from within
So I am done livin' my lifе just for you
You watched me wither and now you'll watch mе bloom
You're hidin' in the dark, but I'm reachin' for the sun, woo
'Cause I am more than what I am to you
You say I'm pretty, but I've got magic that you never knew
And I won't be confined to your point of view
I'm breakin' through the glass you put me in 'cause
I am more than what I am to you
You say I'm perfect, but I've got thorns with my petals too
And I won't be confined to your point of view
I'm breakin' through the glass you put me in

>>>The Grudge Olivia Rodrigo
<sos>
I have nightmares each week about that Friday in May
One phone call from you and my entire world was changed
Trust that you betrayed, confusion that still lingers
Took everything I loved and crushed it in between your fingers
And I doubt you ever think about the damage that you did
But I hold on to every detail like my life depends on it
My undying love, now, I hold it like a grudge
And I hear your voice every time that I think I'm not enough
And I try to be tough, but I wanna scream
How could anybody do the things you did so easily?
And I say I don't care, I say that I'm fine
But you know I can't let it go, I've tried, I've tried, I've tried for so long
It takes strength to forgive, but I don't feel strong
The arguments that I've won against you in my head
In the shower, in the car and in the mirror before bed
Yeah, I'm so tough when I'm alone and I make you feel so guilty
And I fantasize about a time you're a little fucking sorry
And I try to understand why you would do this all to me
You must be insecure, you must be so unhappy
And I know, in my heart, hurt people hurt people
And we both drew blood, but, man, those cuts were never equal
And I try to be tough, but I wanna scream
How could anybody do the things you did so easily?
And I say I don't care, I say that I'm fine
But you know I can't let it go, I've tried, I've tried, I've tried for so long
It takes strength to forgive, but I don't feel strong
Ooh, do you think I deserved it all?
Ooh, your flowers filled with vitriol
You built me up to watch me fall
You have everything and you still want more
I try to be tough, I try to be mean
But even after all this, you're still everything to me
And I know you don't care, I guess that that's fine
But you know I can't let it go, I've tried, I've tried, I've tried for so long
It takes strength to forgive, but I'm not quite sure I'm there yet
It takes strength to forgive, but

Brown guilty eyes and
Little white lies, yeah
I played dumb, but I always knew
That you talked to her, maybe did even worse
I kept quiet so I could keep you
And ain't it funny how you ran to her
The second that we called it quits?
And ain't it funny how you said you were friends?
Now it sure as hell don't look like it
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You talked to her when we were together
Loved you at your worst, but that didn't matter
It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor
Now you bring her around just to shut me down
Show her off like she's a new trophy
And I know if you were true, there's no damn way that you
Could fall in love with somebody that quickly
And ain't it funny? All the twisted games
All the questions you used to avoid
Ain't it funny? Remember I brought her up
And you told me I was paranoid?
And I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You talked to her when we were together
Loved you at your worst, but that didn't matter
It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still a traitor
God, I wish that you had thought this through
Before I went and fell in love with you
When she's sleepin' in the bed we made
Don't you dare forget about the way
'Cause I know that you'll never feel sorry
For the way I hurt, yeah
You talked to her when we were together
You gave me your word, but that didn't matter
It took you two weeks to go off and date her
Guess you didn't cheat, but you're still, you're still a traitor
Yeah, you're still a traitor
God, I wish that you had thought this through

Hate to give the satisfaction asking how you're doing now
How's the castle built off people you pretend to care about?
Just what you wanted
Look at you, cool guy, you got it
I see the parties and the diamonds sometimes when I close my eyes
Six months of torture you sold as some forbidden paradise
I loved you truly
You gotta laugh at the stupidity
'Cause I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naive
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire
And every girl I ever talked to told me you were bad, bad news
You called them crazy, God, I hate the way I called 'em crazy too
How do you lie without flinching?
Oh, what a mesmerizing, paralyzing, fucked up little thrill
Can't figure out just how you do it and God knows I never will
Went for me and not her
'Cause girls your age know better
I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night
I used to think I was smart
But you made me look so naive
The way you sold me for parts
As you sunk your teeth into me, oh
Bleedin' me dry like a goddamn vampire
You said it was true love, but wouldn't that be hard?
You can't love anyone 'cause that would mean you had a heart
I tried to help you out, now I know that I can't
'Cause how you think's the kind of thing I'll never understand
I've made some real big mistakes
But you make the worst one look fine
I should've known it was strange
You only come out at night

You're friends with all my demons
The only one that sees them
Too bad for you
So sad, but true
Gave a hundred million reasons
But why can't you believe them?
Too bad for you
Yeah, we fight and we fuck until we open the cuts
And now we're soberin' up but never sober enough
Instead of holdin' me down, you're only holding me up
It shouldn't be so hard, this is impossible love
I took your pills and your drugs just to feel something else
'Cause I can't feel you no more
So sad, but true
You're friends with all my demons
The only one that sees them
Too bad for you

I doubt it, forget about it, whatever
And the dial tone is all I have
I ain't proud of all the punches that I've thrown
In the name of someone I no longer know
For the shame of bein' young, drunk, and alone
Traffic lights and a transmitter radio
I don't like that when they threw me in the car
I gave your name as my emеrgency phone call
Honey, it rang and rang
Evеn the cops thought you were wrong for hangin' up
I dial drunk, I'll die a drunk, I'll die for you
Drinks pourin', couldn't stop it
Turn another slow dance into a mosh pit
Tuck my head, then I heard the lock and
Told him that my first car was a Crown Vic
Talkin' 'bout last time I was in the back of a cop car
I fell in love
And my face on the cold window
Try to sober back up and loosen my cuffs
And it's all the same anyway

Fuck that, sir, just let me call

Used to keep 'em close, now they dead to me 
Used to have friends, now I got enemies 
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad
They said I would never get this far, ah, ah
Think that we don't see who you are, are, are?
Laughin' to the bank like ha, ha, ha
Guess that I'm just talkin' too much blah, blah, blah 
So, where did y'all go? 
When I was shit broke, couldn't even buy smokes
Now your mama needs tickets to my stadium show 
She love it when she hear me on the radio, oh
I know it's hard to swallow your pride
Sorry that you can't get over me 
Now you're out my life, I'm so relieved, I
Used to have friends, now I got enemies 
Used to keep 'em close, now they dead to me 
Money tend to show all they tendencies 
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad
Sometimes, every time, they let me down 
Used to have friends, now I got enemies
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad
Close to my enemies 
I need better energy 
When I told you fuck you, you thought I was playin', huh?
 But I meant the shit literally
She want to vibe but I told her fuck that 
She looking at me like she surprised
They're packin' the post and I'm home alone
When the box hit the door, they go for 35
I try to put on for my partners, they turn into enemies right before a nigga eye
You reach for a shake, I'ma hold out a fist
Giving a nigga a quarter pound without the fries
I just went double platinum with no features
Just to show a nigga I don't really need him
Pass a man a plate and he can make it shake
It's guaranteed he'll fold and bite the hand that feed him
And I know you think that I ain't see it
And I know you bitch ain't got a car
Don't make me go and buy a bitch a lil' Prius
Fuck on the camera, we can call it even
Friends are like the autumn, every year they leavin'
And I'ma rake 'em in a pile, throw 'em in a bag
Tie them bitches up and leave 'em
'Cause most of these niggas are deceiving
Used to have friends, now I got enemies 
Used to keep 'em close, now they dead to me 
Money tend to show all they tendencies 
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad
Sometimes, every time, they let me down 
Used to have friends, now I got enemies
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad
It's too late to turn this shit around 
Only held me down when you wanted me to drown
It's too late to turn this shit around 
So don't try and tell me that you're happy for me now
Used to have friends, now I got enemies
Used to keep 'em close, now they dead to me 
Money tend to show all they tendencies 
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad
Sometimes, every time, they let me down 
Used to have friends, now I got enemies
Enemies, yeah, it's so sad
Ooh, it's too late
2 AM, they ran out of lemonade
So I shot that vodka straight, anyway
She came in, missin' bottle off the shelf
I can't drink this by myself, sit with me, babe
Then I started laughin'
Like it was funny, but it really ain't funny, uh
Take me home, don't shut me out
It's easier to leave me down here on the ground
Take me home, baby, I'm fucked up now
I know it's easier to leave me down here on the ground
'Cause enough is enough
I can't stand up
I can't stand, can't stand, 'causе enough is enough
Long nights in the city of sin
Thеy said I pick fights that I won't ever win
I got a bad bitch that'll bring all her friends
But when I'm with you it's like I'm livin' again
And baby, I'm shit-faced sittin' on the sidewalk
Ain't nobody listenin' when I talk
I fall down and laugh, but it really ain't funny, uh
Take me home, don't shut me out
It's easier to leave me down here on the ground
Take me home, baby, I'm fucked up now
I know it's easier to leave me down here on the ground
'Cause enough is enough 
I can't stand up 
I can't stand, can't stand, 'cause enough is enough 
Hah, hah, I can't stand up
Ah-ah-ah, I, I can't stand, can't stand
2 AM, they ran out of lemonade
So I shot that vodka straight, anyway

Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Wakin' up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around
Turn me back like woah-woah, woah-woah, oh-oh-oh
Woah, woah-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?
Yeah, do you see us in Vegas pushin' a Monte Carlo?
Bet that money on baby, bet she don't leave me, oh, no
See them heat waves in the desert, look like a lake in the sand
Would you watch the sun burn out with me forever, ever, ever, ever?
You still intimidate me, keep me up on my toes now
Better man, what you made me
Made me aware of what I was missin'
Been missin' the way you give me envision, babe
Never thought I'd settle down, reckon I lied to myself
I was busy focusin' on bein' by myself
Set my feelings to the side, they all got dusty on a shelf
You wiped them down when I had nothin' left
Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Wakin' up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around
Turn me back like woah-woah, woah-woah, oh-oh-oh
Woah, woah-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?
When you asked me if I cheated, I said never 
What are you willing to do to stay together? 
How many times we gonna break up for the summer?
How many times you gonna try to call my mother? 
Girl, you're killin' me, I don't wanna act like I can fix this 
I don't wanna be the one that's changed since Texas
Currency, it comes so naturally, but I can't buy your love
Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Wakin' up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around
Turn me back like woah-woah, woah-woah, oh-oh-oh
Woah, woah-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?
I promise I'm gonna love you 'til my dying day
Wake up, your face in my chest, your favorite hiding place
The roof is gone as we're driving out the private gate
Countin' the stars with our last name on the license plate
Woah, oh, oh, oh
I lied to myself 'bout trying to be here all alone
When I leave, it's bye for now, it's just never bye for long
Set my feelings aside, let's settle down
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around
Turn me back like woah-woah, woah-woah, oh-oh-oh
Woah, woah-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?

They help me forget that this world is so cold
I don't even know what I'm chasin' no more
Tell me what I want, just keep searchin' on
It's never enough, cup after cup
Blunt after blunt, I wouldn't give one if I could find a fuck
Ha, ha, ha, uh, in the cut and I put that on my mama
And my bitch called talkin' 'bout some drama
I swear there ain't no time for women on the come up
It's either pussy or the commas
Man, I just wanna go flex
Gold on my teeth and on my neck
And I'm stone cold with the flex
With my squad and I'm smokin' up a check
Man, I just wanna go flex

She got a man but she says she really like me
She doin' things to excite me
She sendin' all her friends snaps of my new tracks

Me and Kurt feel the same, too much pleasure is pain
My girl spites me in vain, all I do is complain
She needs something to change, need to take off the e-e-edge
So fuck it all tonight
And don't tell me to shut up
When you know you talk too much
But you don't got shit to say 
I want you out of my head
I want you out of my bedroom tonight 
There's no way I could save you 
'Cause I need to be saved too
I'm no good at goodbyes
We're both actin' insane, but too stubborn to change
Now I'm drinkin' again, 80 proof in my veins
And my fingertips stained, looking over the e-e-edge
Don't fuck with me tonight
Say you needed this heart, then you got it 
Turns out that it wasn't what you wanted 
And we wouldn't let go and we lost it
Now I'm a goner
I want you out of my head 
I want you out of my bedroom tonight 
There's no way I could save you 
'Cause I need to be saved too 
I'm no good at goodbyes
I want you out of my life
I want you back here tonight
I'm tryna cut you, no knife
I wanna slice you and dice you
My argue possessive, it got you precise
Can you not turn off the TV? I'm watchin' the fight
I flood the garage, blue diamond, no shark
You're Barbie life doll, it's Nicki Minaj
You don't need a key to drive, your car on the charger
I just wanna see the side, the one that's unbothered 
And I don't want ya to never go outside 
I promise if they play, my niggas slidin' 
I'm fuckin' her, and the tour bus still ridin' 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I want you out of my head 
I want you out of my bedroom tonight 
There's no way I could save you

Stayed down 'til I came up
I did it, I did it, I did it
Ten toes and never changed up
I did it, I did it, I did it
Got my hands in the air right now 'cause I always wanna be here right now
I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it , I did it, I did it, I did it
Take it off then bend over, let me see it
If you're lookin' for a trill type bitch, let me be it
I'm from the South, never had a handout
'Fore I let my people starve, I'll take it out your mouth
These bitches so quick to switch up
I'm from the Lone Star, I don't need to clique up
It ain't directed, so it ain't respected
Stop droppin' clues 'cause I ain't no detective, bitch
I'm tryna win, don't care how I do it, just know that I did it
Why you so worried 'bout what I be doin'?
Countin' my money ain't makin' you rich
Talkin' down on me don't make you the shit
How my name in your mouth more than your spit?
I really encourage my haters to talk
Throwin' that shade only keepin' me lit, huh
Stayed down 'til I came up
I did it, I did it, I did it
Ten toes and never changed up
I did it, I did it, I did it
Got my hands in the air right now 'cause I always wanna be here right now
I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it
Hey, goddammit, I get it
They don't like to see when we win, but I did it
Hey, I stand by my city
Chopsticks sound like a guitar in the air
Stop and take a picture when I'm jumpin' off a Lear
I done ran it up, it only took a couple years
The money be callin', if it wasn't for my lil' partner
Then the bullshit they be talkin' 'bout, I wouldn't even hear
New sports car go, "Vroom," switch gears
Hey, how you? Goddamn, come here
Thought of goin' vegan, then again, I'm like, "For what?"
I got ten karats each in my left and right ears
'21 Tesla, I don't even gotta steer
My climax ain't even nowhere near it
I stayed down and I stayed down
And I came up, I had faith in my spirit
Stayed down 'til I came up
I did it, I did it, I did it
Ten toes and never changed up
I did it, I did it, I did it
Got my hands in the air right now 'cause I always wanna be here right now
I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it , I did it, I did it, I did it
Diamonds on my neck
New contract, I ain't signin' that ho yet
Private plane flyin' somewhere, smilin' on the jet
I drop hit after hit, now that's the domino effect
These niggas out here goin' flat
Ain't no stoppin' it, pink and blue paper all day like Monopoly
Brand new Pradas, I'm proud of me
Actually came from the bottom
Ain't no need in even askin' me, ain't even seen the half of me
And ain't no passin', that's a no-go
Start them killer player niggas out here throwin' low blows
I done got good with the shit
I tell the paparazzi, "Get my angle," every time they take my photo 
Stayed down 'til I came up
I did it, I did it, I did it
Ten toes and never changed up
I did it, I did it, I did it
Got my hands in the air right now 'cause I always wanna be here right now
I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it, I did it

I really hope it was no lying
'Cause when heart breaks it feel like the world's gone
But if the love's real, you'd feel your soul roar like a lion
And you'd finally let bygones be bygones
Don't throw in the towеl, I know it feels like you're the only onе trying
You just gotta learn to live and love on
I belong with the one put on this Earth for me
Everybody has their someone, just gotta look and see
I'm screaming out, "Lord, help me, I've been lonely"
That's when you accept me, then you set me free
Uh, sometimes life's a mess
Uh, I get high when I'm upset
I remember when me and love didn't click
Searchin' for somethin' real, then I found it
Uh, sometimes life's a mess
Yeah, I get high when I'm upset
I remember when me and love ain't click
Lookin' for somethin' real, then I found it
Have you ever fallen head over heels for somebody
That made promises to give you the world?
And I swear I would never leave you cold
There ain't no one above you
You were way too high to touch
I was high enough to pass out
When you was so alone, I was a stone's throw away
I remember those lips, I remember how they taste
I been staring at the wall, doing nothing all day
I remember everything, put the bottle to my face, Dom Pé
If you gave up on me now, I would seriously be so fucked up
I'm doing everything I can just to keep myself from throwing up
Never gave a fuck what they say 'bout us
Fuck all of you muh-fuckers slow me up
And fuck everything that ruined us
I'm three seconds away from pulling out my gun
Uh, sometimes life's a mess
Uh, I get high when I'm upset
I remember when me and love didn't click
Searchin' for somethin' real, then I found it
Uh, sometimes life's a mess
Yeah, I get high when I'm upset
I remember when me and love ain't click
Lookin' for somethin' real, then I found it
Thank God I finally found you
You put the light in my eyes when I'm around you
I'm too flawed to hold you down, but
Don't wanna be here alone
And I thank God I finally found you
I'll put the light in your eyes if I'm allowed to
I'm too flawed to hold you down, but
Don't let me be here alone

Don't wanna sober up
The sun is killin' my buzz, that's why they call it mourning
Thought I was strong enough
Threw my bottle at the sky, said, "God, that's a warning"
Don't wanna sober up
Try to keep it inside, but I just wanna pour it
Thought I was strong enough
Got a lotta shit to say, couldn't fit it in the chorus
I just left Wally's, spent a Maserati
The way I gotta flex, you'd think I did Pilates
I call my quote-unquote friends, "Do you got plans?"
Turns out everyone's free when the dinner is
Then they drag me to a party out in Malibu
After thirty High Noons, it was pretty cool
Tried to shoot my shot, she told me that she had a shoot
Don't wanna sober up
The sun is killin' my buzz, that's why they call it mourning
Thought I was strong enough
Threw my bottle at the sky, said, "God, that's a warning"
Don't wanna sober up
Try to keep it inside, but I just wanna pour it
Thought I was strong enough
Got a lotta shit to say, couldn't fit it in the chorus
Stumblin' down the corridor, came across an open door
Throwin' up is easy and who put on the Commodores?
That's a nice tile floor, wish I got to know you more
Who am I talkin' to? Nobody
Take me outside, I'm a little too high
Paid a little too much for the time of my life
When money ain't a problem, everyone's lyin'
Even when I tell myself that I
Don't wanna sober up
The sun is killin' my buzz, that's why they call it mourning
Thought I was strong enough
Threw my bottle at the sky, said, "God, that's a warning"

Try to take anything to keep my sane, I've been hustlin', I been grindin' hard, on my mama
Side ho actin' lame, with my main I been fussin', I got too much money for these problems
I wan' take these drugs with my friends, huh, oh

You can't trust these hoes, I won't hold you, that's what it is, yeah
Huh, I'm too real

I wan' count up every day I'm out
Pull up to this party, not for fun
Make sure I stack my money tall
Know that I look nice enough for someone
Fresher, I might leave here with lil' shawty
Ayy, all this drama, baby, I'm too rich for that
Ayy, all these commas like I'm an aristocrat
Ayy, in Bahamas, posted with my bitch with that
Say that he want problems, it's no problem, we got shit for that
Windows tinted, whip is all black
And my credit card lookin' all platinum
And your bitch told me she want all action
Hit it once with a gold Magnum
I don't really care 'bout what the blogs say
'Cause my mama good and my dogs straight
You know if you could, you'd be on the same
I'm in Hollywood, gettin' all faded
I swear, I can't take breaks, I'm too young
Strip club, throwin' up dubs
You can't tell me nothin'
Two hundred in my cup
I was paid to be in this club
No, I don't do shit for fun

Hey, I can't have my baby rocker rockin' knockoffs
Hey, my buddies gonna slide and maybe spin that block off
Hey, fishtail off that lot and chop-chop-chop that top off
I can't do this alone
She a pain on the tone
If you say you will follow me down
I would happily drown
 I done made it out the storm
 Check my bank, I made new commas
 I can't take no break, I'm way too young

Wake me up when the season's gone

So what do I do?
Oh, what do I do?
I get fucked up just 'cause I'm scared
Love's just another drug I have grown a victim to
So what do I do?
Oh, what do I do?
All is fair in love and war
So what the hell are we even fightin' for?
I'm on your front porch beggin' for my dawns back
Give my goddamn records and my clothes back
Oh, how I'm through
And by the time she wakes
I'll be halfway to my mama's home
It just dawned on me
Life is as fleeting as the passin' dawn
And it was my mistake
'Cause she never said a thing about Jesus
I miss my mother's southern drawl
And her prayin' through the walls in the evening
Give me my dawns back
Everything that dies makes its way back
I lost her last July in a heart attack
I need one small victory 
Give me my dawns back
'Cause everything that dies makes its way on back
I lost her last July in a heart attack
I need one small victory
Wake me up when the season's gone
'Cause I've wasted all my dawns on you
So what do I do?
Oh, what do I do?
And by the time he wakes
I'll be halfway to my best friend's home
It just dawned on me
Life is as fleeting as the passin' dawn
And I shoulda told him twice
I believe in somethin' bigger than both of us
I miss goin' out to bars, shootin' stars
Not worryin' 'bout what's left of us, mm
Mm, give me my dawns back
Everything that dies makes its way on back
I lost her last July in a heart attack
I need one small victory 
Give me my dawns back
Everything that dies makes its way on back

I need one small victory

>>>Heading South Zach Bryan
<sos>
Was a boy who was a dreamer and he flew so high and proud
In a world full of people out to cut his young ass down
No one ever understood a single word he said
And they cast him to the wolves when he wasn’t well and fed
Boys we’ve got a riser, a riser in our midst
He will get the last laugh if it’s the last thing he did
And he used to roll around in that red dirt mud
But now he’s skipping town and that riser's out for blood
Don’t stop goin’, goin’ south
'Cause they’ll let you play your music real damn loud
Don’t stop headin’, headin’ south
'Cause they will understand thе words that are pouring from your mouth
Then that boy he callеd his daddy to tell him what he did
As the masses scream the lyrics of a messed up kid
And then he told that old man he was never comin' back
To be cut down again in a town like that
Then he surely came to learn people come to watch you fall
He's out to make a name and a fool out of ‘em all
And they’ll never understand that boy and his kind
All they comprehend is a fuckin' dollar sign
So don't stop goin', goin' south
'Cause they’ll let you play your music real damn loud
Don’t stop headin’, headin’ south
'Cause they will understand the words that are pourin' from your mouth
Don’t stop goin’, goin’ south
They will understand the words that are pourin' from your mouth
Don't stop goin', goin' south
'Cause they'll let you scream your music real damn loud

Rot gut whiskey's gonna ease my mind
Beach towel rests on the dryin' line
Do I remind you of your daddy in his '88 Ford?
Labrador hangin' out the passenger door
The sand from your hair is blowin' in my eyes
Blame it on the beach, grown men don't cry
Do you remember that beat down basement couch?
I'd sing you my love songs and you'd tell me about
How your mama ran off and pawned her ring
I remember, I remember everything
A cold shoulder at closing time
You were bеggin' me to stay 'til the sun rose
Strangе words come on out
Of a grown man's mouth when his mind's broke
Pictures and passin' time
You only smile like that when you're drinkin'
I wish I didn't, but I do
Remember every moment on the nights with you
You're drinkin' everything to ease your mind
But when the hell are you gonna ease mine?
You're like concrete feet in the summer heat
It burns like hell when two souls meet
No, you'll never be the man that you always swore
But I'll remember you singin' in that '88 Ford
A cold shoulder at closing time
You were beggin' me to stay 'til the sun rose
Strange words come on out
Of a grown man's mouth when his mind's broke
Pictures and passin' time
You only smile like that when you're drinkin'
I wish I didn't, but I do
Remember every moment on the nights with you
Cold shoulder at closing time
You were beggin' me to stay 'til the sun rose
Strange words come on out
Of a grown man's mouth when his mind's broke
Pictures and passin' time
You only smile like that when you're drinkin'
I wish I didn't, but I do
Remember every moment on the nights with you

It'll be fine by dusk light, I'm tellin' you, baby
These things eat at your bones and drive your young mind crazy
But when you place your head between my collar and jaw
I don't know much, but there's no weight at all
And I'm damned if I do and I'm damned if I don't
'Cause if I say I miss you, I know that you won't
But I miss you in the mornings when I see the sun
Somethin' in the orange tells me we're not done
To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home
I need to hear you say you've been waitin' all night
There's orange dancin' in your eyes from bulb light
Your voice only trembles when you try to speak
Take me back to us dancin', this wood used to creak
To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home
To you, I'm just a man; to me, you're all I am
Where the hell am I supposed to go?
I poisoned myself again, somethin' in the orange
Tells me you're never comin' home
If you leave today, I'll just stare at the way
The orange touches all things around
The grass, trees, and dew, how I just hate you
Please turn those headlights around
Please turn those headlights around

>>>Boys Will Be Boys Dua Lipa

It's second nature to walk home before the sun goes down
And put your keys between your knuckles when there's boys around
Isn't it funny how we laugh it off to hide our fear
When there's nothing funny here? 
Sick intuition that they taught us, so we won't freak out
We hide our figures, doing anything to shut their mouths
We smile away to ease the tension so it don't go south
But there's nothing funny now 
When will we stop saying things
'Cause they're all listening?
No, the kids ain't alright
Oh, and they do what they see
'Cause it's all on TV
Oh, the kids ain't alright
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
I'm sure if there's something that I can't find the words to say
I know that there will be a man around to save the day
And that was sarcasm, in case you needed it mansplained
I should've stuck to ballet 
When will we stop saying things
'Cause they're all listening?
No, the kids ain't alright
Oh, and they do what they see
'Cause it's all on TV
Oh, the kids ain't alright
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
If you're offended by this song
You're clearly doing something wrong
If you're offended by this song
Then you're probably saying
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
When will we stop saying things
'Cause they're all listening?
No, the kids ain't alright
Oh, and they do what they see
'Cause it's all on TV
Oh, the kids ain't alright
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be

>>>Break My Heart Dua Lipa

I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
I wonder, when you go, if I stay on your mind
Two can play that game, but you win me every time
Everyone before you was a waste of time
Yeah, you got me
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home 
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all

'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Ooh, break my heart
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

When the night's here, I don't do tears
I could dance, I could dance, I could dance
Watch me dance, dance the night away
My hеart could be burnin', but you won't see it on my face
Watch me dancе, dance the night away 
I'll still keep the party runnin', not one hair out of place
Lately, I been movin' close to the edge
Still be lookin' my best
I stay on the beat, you can count on me
I ain't missin' no steps
'Cause every romance shakes and it bends
Don't give a damn
When the night's here, I don't do tears
I could dance, I could dance, I could dance
Watch me dance, dance the night away
My heart could be burnin', but you won't see it on my face
Watch me dance, dance the night away 
I'll still keep the party runnin', not one hair out of place
When my heart breaks 
When my world shakes 
I don't play safe , don't you know about me? 
I could dance, I could dance, I could dance
Even when the tears are flowin', they're diamonds on my face
I'll still keep the party goin', not one hair out of place 
Even when the tears are flowin', they're diamonds on my face

You know that sometimes I think about us now and then
But I never wanna fall again, ah
Yo no te quisiera olvidar 
Pero contigo es todo o na' 
You're deep in the water, yeah, you're drownin' us
You question my love like it's not enough
But I hate that you know, you know, you know
You got me tied up
You regret it now, but it's your mistake
What makes you think that my mind will change?
And you hate that you know, you know, you know
You know you messed up
One day you'll love me again
One day you'll love me for sure
One day you'll wake up feelin' how I've been feelin'
Baby, you'll knock at my door
One day you'll love me again
Hug me again till the end
One day you'll beg me to try
One day you'll realize I'm more than your lover
I'm more than your lover, I'm your friend
Acércate un poquito na' má'
Que yo quiero que te quedes conmigo
Deja a tus amiga' allá atrás, que no' vamos en un viaje escondido'
No' vamo' pa' Turks and Caicos
Y ahí calmamo' las ganas 
Suéltate conmigo, mamá 
Que ya no hay marcha atrás
Una noche sin ti
No es tan fácil, baby
Que yo soy pa' ti 
Y tú eres pa' mí 
Nunca me dejes de querer
Contigo por siempre, baby
No quiero dejarte esta vez
One day you'll love me again
One day you'll love me for sure
One day you'll wake up feelin' how I've been feelin'
Baby, you'll knock at my door
One day you'll love me again
Hug me again till the end
One day you'll beg me to try
One day you'll realize I'm more than your lover
I'm more than your lover, I'm your friend
Yo sé que estoy en tu corazón, quizá en el fondo
Otra baby me escribe, nunca le respondo 
La vida da vuelta' y el mundo es redondo
Y yo voy a que te beso de nuevo en London
O si no en Marbella 
Encima de la arena viendo la' estrella' 
Yo sé que ni la' ola' han borra'o mi huella 
Pero tu pichaera e' lo que me atropella
Sol, playa y en la arena, vamo' allá 
Baby, no te quede' callá'
Yo sé que tú quiere' guayar conmigo
Otra vez me tienes en depresión
Fumando en la habitación, eh
Pero yo sé que
One day you'll love me again

If you don't wanna see me
Did a full one-eighty, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now 
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Don't start now 
Don't come out, out
I'm not where you left me at all, so
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Don't show up , don't come out 
Don't start caring about me now 
Walk away , you know how 
Don't start caring about me now 
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up

When I’m with you
Giving up my ghost for you
And now I'm see-through
You give me a feeling, feeling so strong
I know you've been treating, treating yourself wrong
So let me care for you
I’ma love you differently

Give it to you
And even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you, you know
I wanna let you know, I'll never let this feeling go

Usually, usually, usually, I don't pay no mind
And when it came down, I was lookin' in your eyes
Suddenly, suddenly, suddenly, I can feel it inside
I've got a fever, so can you check?
Hand on my forehead, kiss my neck
And when you touch me, baby, I turn red
I've got a fever, so can you check? 
Peut-être qu'avec du temps, ça partira
Et pourtant, et pourtant, et pourtant, je ne m'y vois pas
Comme un médicament, moi, je suis rien sans toi
Et je sais quе j'essaie, que jе perds du temps dans tes bras
I've got a fever, so can you check?
Hand on my forehead, kiss my neck
And when you touch me, baby, I turn red
I've got a fever, so can you check?
Car dans mes yeux, ça se voit 
La fièvre dans les yeux, oui, ça se voit 
Mon cœur se serre, j'ai du feu dans la voix 
Le plus souvent, c'est quand je pense à toi 
I've got a fever, can you check?
Hand on my forehead, kiss my neck
And when you touch me, baby, I turn red

Tell me what you wanna do right now 
Tell me what you wanna do right now
'Cause I don't really wanna cool it down 
Tell me what you wanna do right now
Tell me what you wanna do right now

Longing, and I'm leaving
I go, I go, I go

Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
I see you tryna get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna get to me 
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck

We haven't talked all morning
Bang my head, bang my head against the wall
I'm scared, I'm falling
Losing all, losing all my control
And I'm tired of talking
Feel myself saying the same old things
But this love's important
Don't wanna lose, don't wanna lose you this way
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Feel like we about to break up
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Just wanna kiss and make up one last time
Touch me like you touch nobody
Put your hands all up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
How about we leave this party?
'Cause all I want is you up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
아직 너를 못 떠나고
뭘 하고 있는 건지
언젠가는 다 끝날 걸
다시 고쳐 볼 수는 없을지
아무런 말도 넌 하지 마
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Feel like we about to break up
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Just wanna kiss and make up one last time
Touch me like you touch nobody
Put your hands all up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
How about we leave this party?
'Cause all I want is you up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
그게 뭐가 되었건 다 필요 없어, 너면 됐어
So tell me, can we work this whole thing out?
Work this whole thing out
날 첨 만났던, 설레던 순간 그때처럼
So tell me, can we work this whole thing out?
Work this whole thing out
Kiss, kiss and make up
Touch me like you touch nobody
Put your hands all up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
How about we leave this party?
'Cause all I want is you up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up

Yeah, we might just end up crashin'
But I'm ready if it happens with you
Meet me out in Cali when I'm far away from family
And I need someone to hold onto
You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone
We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby, take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Like it's our last dance
My heart wide open
Fallin' in and out of focus
Pressure flowin' like a river in my head
Crying you ain't with me and it's floodin' the whole city
While my soul's burnin' like a cigarette
You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone
We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby, take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Like it's our last dance
Way too soon to feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long
Was it worth it?
Way too soon to feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long
Was it worth it?
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance

Shining just the way I like

I never thought I'd hear my heart beat so loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
I used to think that I was made out of stone
I used to spend so many nights on my own
I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again
You got me in love again
So many nights, my tears fell harder than rain
Scared I would take my broken heart to the grave
I'd rather die than have to live in a storm like before
But goddamn, you got me in love again
Show me that heaven's right here, baby

Used to be afraid of love and what it might do

Now it's getting quiet here, now it's getting blue
And this, baby, ain't no fair, taking up my youth
You've been telling me some lies, I be thinking it's the truth
But I see it in your eyes, the things that you do
I don't wanna waste no time all alone
Want somewhere to go, something to call my own
And I ain't satisfied, where to go?
Lost out on the road, washed up on the shore
And I've been through mountains and seas
Tryna get you to come back to me
And I've been far, and I've been so deep
Now I find it harder and harder to breathe
And I need some new love
New love, new love
Even though I've run away, I still come back
No, there's nothing more to say, it's all been said
I've been trying to explain the things we had
To all of my friends who say that I've gone mad
I don't wanna waste no time all alone
Want somewhere to go, something to call my own
And I ain't satisfied, where to go?
Lost out on the road, washed up on the shore
And I've been through mountains and seas
Tryna get you to come back to me
And I've been far, and I've been so deep
Now I find it harder and harder to breathe
And I need some new love
New love, new love
And I need some new love
New love, new love
Easy come, easy go
Why are we living on, living on?
If we're not getting on, getting on?
Can we just let it go?
Cause we're waiting for a miracle
Why wait for a miracle? Yeah
And I've been through mountains and seas
Tryna get you to come back to me
And I've been far, and I've been so deep
Now I find it harder and harder to breathe
And I need some new love
New love, new love
And I need some new love
New love, new love

Hands on each other
Couldn't stand to be far apart
Now we're picking fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Too much time, losing track of us
Where was the real?
Undefined, spiraling out of touch
Forgot how it feels

That body lookin' nice 
I got cake and I know he want a slice
I wish a nigga would try to put me on ice 
I ain't never had to chase dick in my life 
I like that nasty, that freaky stuff 
Slip under my bed and keep me up 
That Hansel and Gretel, let him eat me up 
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Ooh, this the ride of your life
Hold on 'cause, baby, I might
I might just give you a bite of the sweetest pie 
Ooh, baby, we can go fast
I'll drive and you just lay back 
I got the flavour that lasts, yeah, the sweetest pie
I might take you home with this, I might give you all of it
Come get your dose of the sweetest pie
Ooh, this the ride of your life
Hold on 'cause, baby, I might
I might just give you a bite of the sweetest pie 
You got me hung up from across the room
I'm so high that I'm on another altitude
And on my cloud, I got some space for you
Got a taste for you, ayy
More bounce to the ounce, pick it up, put it down 
Wanna put his Nutty Buddy in my Fudge Round 
Pussy tighter than a bitch, he ain't had it like this
Toes curling like they're throwing gang signs on Crip 
One thing about me, I ain't takin' no shit
He whipped, I know it's pissin' off his old bitch
Cesar Millan, I got his ass trained 
Tryna let a dog know who really run things 
You've never been to Heaven, have you?
Ooh, this the ride of your life
Hold on 'cause, baby, I might
I might just give you a bite of the sweetest pie 
Ooh, baby, we can go fast
I'll drive and you just lay back 
I got the flavour that lasts, yeah, the sweetest pie 
I might take you home with this, I might give you all of it
Come get your dose of the sweetest pie

>>>Thinking 'Bout You Dua Lipa
<sos>
3 A.M. and my neighbors hate me
Music blasting, shaking these walls
This time Mary Jane won't save me
I've been working later, I've been drinking stronger
I've been smoking deeper but the memories won't stop
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
Like poison coursing through me
So clear my vision is blurred
The haze won't put my mind at ease
I've been sleeping later, I've been breathing stronger
I've been digging deeper, but the memories won't stop
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I want you all
Say it before you run out of time
I want you all
Say it before it's too late
I want you all
Say what I am feeling now
I want you all
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you

>>>We're Good Dua Lipa

I'm on an island, even when you're close
Can't take the silence, I'd rather be alone
I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good
We're not meant to be, like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good
No need to hide it, go get what you want
This won't be a burden if we both don't hold a grudge
I think it's pretty plain and simple, we gave it all we could
It's time I wave goodbye from the window
Let's end this like we should and say we're good
We're not meant to be, like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good
Now you're holding this against me like I knew you would
I'm trying my best to make this easy
So don't give me that look, just say we're good
We're not meant to be, like sleeping and cocaine
So let's at least agree to go our separate ways
Not gonna judge you when you're with somebody else
As long as you swear you won't be pissed when I do it myself
Let's end it like we should and say we're good

>>>2step Ed Sheeran
<sos>
I had a bad week
Spent the evening pretending it wasn't that deep
You could see in my eyes that it was taking over
I guess I was just blind and caught up in the moment
You know you take all of my stress right down
Help me get it off my chest and out
Into the ether with the rest of this mess that just keeps us depressed
We forget that we're here right now
'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace
Stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn
If we're missin' out on what the people think is right
Seein' through a picture behind the screen and forget to be
Lose the conversation for the message that you'll never read
I think maybe you and me
Oh, we should head out to the place where the music plays
We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone, then loved
And all we need is us to go all
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All we need is us
What do you reckon, is it just me?
Words are weapons and occasionally they cut deep
Crisis of confidence, it tends to come when I feel the dark and I open my heart
If you don't see it, you should trust me
I feel like I got nothin' left right now
Except this beauty in her dress right now
She got me feelin' like the best and the rest are just less than she needs
So we press play and step to the beat
'Cause we're livin' life at a different pace
Stuck in a constant race
Keep the pressure on, you're bound to break
We should just be cancelling all our plans and not give a damn
Head out to the place where it plays and
We'll go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All my troubles turn to nothin' when I'm in your eyes, electrified
We'll keep turnin' up and go all night
Oh, we had dips and falls in our time
But we know what it feels to be low then up, alone and loved
And all we need is us to go all
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All we need is us to go all night
Two-steppin' with the woman I love
All we need is us to go all night

>>>1000 Nights Ed Sheeran

Oh, I been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights
This the type of shit we used to dream of 
Bad bitch look like Mona Lisa 
Flippin' off a yacht in Ibiza 
Clear port, hasta la vista
Do it all again when we touchdown, everything bust down
Teacher said I would lose, I be like, "What now?"
I started makin' moves, they showin' me love now
Lit like a light bulb 'cause, bitch, I'm the plug now
And now you know we poppin', we bubble like soda poppin'
I see it, I like it, I wake up, pull up, and go and cop it
The millions get wired, them Benny hunnids still go in pocket
I party with Ed Sheeran, my homies still hold a rocket
'Cause I'm so hood, it don't make no sense
Still remember the times I couldn't pay my rent
Now, I walk in a stadiums, tell 'em, "Play my shit"
And they gon' sing like this
Oh, I been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights
Last night, I played a show at a stadium in Atlanta
Husband and wives, daddies and daughters with the cameras
I never thought it would get this big, but why does it matter?
Everything is already part of a plan
I remember, damn, me and my man inside of this Splitter van
200 a night, end of 2010
Stayin' up in every city's Holiday Inn
If it wasn't there, then I was at the couch of a friend's
Wetherspoon's was an easy option to get a cheaper lunch and
£2 pint, the waitress maybe leave her number
On to the next town, but now it's to the next continent 
And I don't think it's gonna be stoppin' anytime soon
Birds eye view, pay my dues for a two-mile queue
Don't need to read reviews if you can't do the things I do
Oh, let me invite you to my world
Oh, I been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded 
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights
Mmm, I'm so faded, yeah
I don't even know how much I made this year
I'm so used to bein' on some player shit
Cheated on my girlfriend with a famous bitch
Hoodie on pull up, just like the Reaper, yeah
I do this on the regular, make you seem unfair
St. Laurent, Gucci sweater, the red and green Moncler
Me and Meek and Ed Sheeran just like the Beatles, yeah
From her head to her toe, she know she be flee, oh yeah
Everyday, I be seein' her and Ceiline, oh yeah
She wanna come closer, but I don't see us there
I'm not a regular person, I be low-key, oh yeah
From New York out to London
She was, she was with me all the time
And I've been on the road, so long she couldn't call my line
And now she got her ass and titties done for a thousand likes
Oh, I been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights

>>>The A Team Ed Sheeran
<sos>
White lips, pale face
Breathin' in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, days end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
The worst things in life come free to us
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe, she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Call girl, no phone
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
The worst things in life come free to us
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
But she don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe, she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
An angel will die
Closed eyes and hopin' for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
The worst things in life come free to us
And we're all under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And we don't wanna go outside tonight
And in a pipe, we fly to the Motherland
Or sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
For angels to die

>>>Afterglow Ed Sheeran
<sos>
Stop the clocks, it's amazing
You should see the way the light dances off your hair
A million colours of hazel, golden, and red
Saturday morning is fading
The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand
My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again
We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle
Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
The weather outside's changing
The leaves are buried under six inches of white
The radio is playing Iron & Wine
This is a new dimension
This is a level where we're losing track of time
I'm holding nothing against it, except you and I
We were love-drunk, waiting on a miracle
Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow

Said I'm all about it
'Cause I got soul and I won't quit
And your dad don't like it when I talk my shit
'Cause I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby
Staying up late just to pass the time
And your parents don’t like it when you out getting high
But I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby
I'm not a rapper just a singer with a game plan
I play guitar no need to worry 'bout my Drake hand
80,000 people in front of the stage, damn
Waiting for the sun to shine just to rock these Ray Bans
I just wanna leak shit 
Not literally leak shit
Wanna push the music through the speakers
Double shot glass, I'm in the back of the pub
My mate Jason at the bar screaming "Who want what?"
Now, please be warned
That every song I feature on has capacity to be reborn
I said that anything can happen when I pick up a pen
But now I'm all about love so won't you say it again
I said I used to be the shy type
Backpack on my back on public transport sort of guy type
Now I'm in the limelight
Tryna get my mind right
Body clock is in the clouds so often guess it's high time
Hoodie sing the line like
'Cause I got soul and I won't quit
And your dad don't like it when I talk my shit
'Cause I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby
Staying up late just to pass the time
And your parents don’t like it when you out getting high
But I'm all about it baby
I'm all about it baby
I'm not a singer, I just rap pretty
So now my fan base is full of Megan's and Ashley's
And they're wondering if there's room for them to get in my bus
And I'm like, "Naturally, baby, let me find a spot in the front"
For you, and for your friends
You can be mine, we can pretend
Oh, typical rapper actin' a typical fashion
I'm doing something that's different
I'm tryin' to Paula my patent
The young prince of Manhattan, now everybody believe it
Adrien Broner the way I'm ducking and weaving
We go together like interceptions and Revis
She said the only rapper she lovin' is Yeezus
One for the money
Two people since the beginning
Three million records get sold and now everybody is winning
I'm Larry David plus Miles Davis
So, everybody hating and fuck it, I hardly blame 'em
'Cause I got soul and I won't quit

I saw a shootin' star and thought of you
I sang a lullaby by the waterside and knew
If you were here, I'd sing to you
You're on the other side, as the skyline splits in two
I'm miles away from seeing you
But I can see the stars from America
I wondered, do you see them too?
So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home
I can hear your heart on the radio beat
They're playin' "Chasing Cars" and I thought of us
Back to the time you were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love
So I took your hand back through lamp lit streets, I knew
Everything led back to you
So can you see the stars over Amsterdam?
You're the song my heart is beatin' to
So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home

>>>Are You Entertained Ed Sheeran

Are you not entertained?
Are you not entertained? 
Every time, every night is a loose one
And every flight, you know that I put the crew on
You say that I dropped off, well, then tell me what you done
I'm still in my winnin' phase, yeah, I been away
Are you entertained? I'm gone 
The god in me, that's what I'm constantly summonin'
I love the climb, I don't care where the summit is
Funny when pеople be sayin' I peakеd 
Retired my parents, they live at the beach
Models and freaks is my track record 
I made my homies my staff members
Got myself lit to give y'all the light
Usin' my mind to attract better
At first when adversity came, I said, "Why me?"
Now I be starin' it down sayin', "Try me"
Kyrie, I handle it well
They still takin' shots, tryna hand me a L
But I pass on that
Anger, I try not to act on that
I'ma just transmute it
Put it all back in the music
It's feelin' like I might just be on a roll
I'm never sellin' my soul
My records are Platinum and Gold
It just keeps happenin', woah
It's feelin' like I might just be on a roll
I'm never sellin' my soul
My records are Platinum and Gold
It just keeps happenin', woah
Every time you see me shine and move up 
My seat is reclined, the jet is G5, I blew up 
You tell me I fell off, but tell me what you done
I'm still in my winnin' phase, 'Rari switchin' lanes
Are you entertained? I'm gone
Well, I'm in the pub with the bros
Lightin' up something that goes, nothin' is froze
But when I put the kettle on
It's a number that nobody knows
I stay off the road, live in the sticks
Put my profit into mortar and bricks
You know I got good advice from a couple guys
To leave more than just stress for my kids
Well, isn't it blissful, baby
Sittin' in like we made it?
It's kinda mad how the game is
You celebrate it and hate it
But I don't pay no attention to the words
Put out another one, let it burn
Still on my list, you know what it is
They puttin' me first, yeah
Met Russ in Carbone in New York
Now we here, and I'm killin' the verse
And every time, it's gotta be right
And he told me, "Teddy, boy, take 'em to church" 
When you touch down up in London, you know what?
Give me the stage and you're gonna see how it goes off
Every time, every night is a loose one
My seat is reclined, the jet is G5, I blew up 
You say that I dropped off, well, then tell me what you done
I'm still in my winnin' phase, 'Rari switchin' lanes
Are you entertained? I'm gone

>>>Bad Habits Ed Sheeran
<sos>
Every time you come around, you know I can't say no
Every time the sun goes down, I let you take control
I can feel the paradise before my world implodes
And tonight had something wonderful
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's truе, it's true
My bad habits lead to you
My bad habits lеad to you
Every pure intention ends when the good times start
Fallin' over everything to reach the first time's spark
It started under neon lights and then it all got dark
I only know how to go too far
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true
My bad habits lead to you
We took the long way 'round
And burned till the fun ran out, now
My bad habits lead to late nights endin' alone
Conversations with a stranger I barely know
Swearin' this'll be the last, but it probably won't
I got nothin' left to lose, or use, or do
My bad habits lead to wide eyes starin' at space
And I know I lose control of the things that I say
Yeah, I was lookin' for a way out, now I can't escape
Nothin' happens after two, it's true, it's true

>>>Barcelona Ed Sheeran

Well, get up, up on the dancefloor tonight
I've got two left feet and a bottle of red wine
Making me feel like the beat and the bassline
Are in my blood, both hands up on her waistline
Get on up, baby, dance to the rhythm of the music
Don't care what the DJ chooses
Get lost in the rhythm of me
Place don't close until we wanna leave it
And you and I, we're flying on an aeroplane tonight
We're going somewhere where the sun is shining bright
Just close your eyes
And let's pretend we're dancing in the street
Well, get up, up on the dancefloor, move, it's a Saturday night
I fell in love with the sparkle in the moonlight
Reflected in your beautiful eyes
I guess that is destiny doing it right
And dance like they do in the Mediterranean
Spin you around me again and again, and
You're like something that God has sent me
I want you, baby, solamente
And you and I, we're flying on an aeroplane tonight
We're going somewhere where the sun is shining bright
Just close your eyes
And let's pretend we're dancing in the street
So let's pretend we're dancing in the street
Las Ramblas, I'll meet you
We'll dance around La Sagrada Familia 
Mi niña, te amo, mi cariño 
Sí, tú, te adoro, señorita 
Nosotros, vivir la vida
Come on, let's be free in Barcelona

We are, we are, we are
L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sundown and they all come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
The party's on, so they're headin' downtown 
Everybody's lookin' for a come up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and
We're just tryna figure everything out
We don't fit in well 'cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become
Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"
Inside the world of beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Prenups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party
That's not who we are 
We are not beautiful
Yeah, that's not who we are 
We are not beautiful 
Drove for hours last night and we made it nowhere 
I see stars in your eyes when we're halfway there 
I'm not fazed by all them lights and flashin' cameras
'Cause with my arms around you, there's no need to care
We don't fit in well, we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah

>>>Best Part of Me Ed Sheeran
<sos>
My lungs are black, my heart is pure
My hands are scarred from nights before
And my hair is thin and falling out of all the wrong places
I am a little insecure
My eyes are crossed, but they're still blue
I bite my nails and tell the truth
I go from thin to overweight, day to day, it fluctuates
My skin is inked, but faded too
But she loves me, she loves me
Why the hell does she love me
When she could have anyone else?
Oh, you love me, you love me
Why the hell do you love me?
'Cause I don't even love myself
Baby, the best part of me is you
And lately, everything's making sense too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you
I overthink and still forget
I lose my phone and place my bets
And I never catch the train on time
Always thirty minutes behind
Your worries ain't seen nothin' yet
But you love me, you love me
Why the hell you love me so
When you could have anyone else?
Yeah, yeah, he loves me, he loves me
And I bet he never lets me go
And shows me how to love myself
'Cause, baby, the best part of me is you
Oh, lately, everything's making sense too
Baby, I'm so in love with you
Da-dum, da-dum, da-dum, da-dum
Baby, the best part of me is you 
Lately, everything's making sense too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you 
Baby, I'm so in love with you

>>>Bibia Be Ye Ye Ed Sheeran
<sos>
Bibia be ye ye
I lost my shoes last night, I don't know where I put my keys
I was tired and fell asleep beneath an oak tree
I bet my mother's proud of me
From each scar upon my knuckle and each graze upon my knee
And all I know
Is I got a cab and then threw up upon his car seat
He kicked me out and then I walked in the rain
I tell myself in every way I won't be doing this again
And tomorrow's a brand new day
Someone told me, "Always say what's on your mind"
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time
Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye
Bibia be ye ye, ye ye, ye ye
Bibia be ye ye
I remember less and less and mostly things that I regret
In my phone are several texts from girls I've never met
And in the pocket of my jeans are only coins and broken dreams
My heart is breaking at the seams and I'm coming apart now
Now things are looking up, I'll find my shoes right next to the oak tree
And I'll get a bus straight into town and spend the afternoon
Looking around for the things that I left on the ground
And say you're with me, tomorrow's a brand new day
Someone told me, "Always say what's on your mind"
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time
Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye

Sippin' on red wine

Rippin' out the pages
How'd I get so faded?
Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me, how'd you never learn?
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind
This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Well, tell me when it kicks in

Thought I'd find her in a bottle
God, make me another one
I'll be feeling this tomorrow
Lord, forgive me for the things I've done
I was never meant to hurt no one
And I saw scars upon a broken-hearted lover
Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now

>>>Boat Ed Sheeran
<sos>
Came in for the embers
Stayed out for the breeze
I need to feel elements to remind me
There's beauty when it's bleak
Stuck out long before lights down
Why do I breathe? Oh, I know
The more that I love, the less that I feel
The times that I jumped never were real
They say that all scars will heal, but I know
But the waves won't break my boat
But the waves won't brеak my boat
The stones crash on the boardwalk
Thе wind rush through the trees
I keep my eyes peeled
The memories always fall short
Of what we could've been
Left out long before last call
What do I need? Oh, I know
The more that I love, the less that I feel
The times that I jumped never were real
They say that all scars will heal, but I know
But the waves won't break my boat
The waves won't break my boat
The more that I love, the less that I feel
The times that I jumped never were real
They say that all scars will heal, but I know
And the waves won't break my boat

>>>Castle on the Hill Ed Sheeran
<sos>
When I was six years old, I broke my leg
I was runnin' from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Drivin' at ninety down those country lanes
Singin' to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Runnin' from the law through the backfields and gettin' drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh, how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Drivin' at ninety down those country lanes
Singin' to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely gettin' by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home
And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill

You see tonight, it could go either way
Hearts balanced on a razor blade
We are designed to love and break
And to rinse and repeat it all again
I get stuck when the world's too loud
And things don't look up when you're goin' down
I know your arms are reachin' out
From somewhere beyond the clouds
You make me feel
Like my troubled heart is a million miles away
You make me feel
Like I'm drunk on stars and we're dancing out in the space
I see the light shining through the rain
A thousand colours in a brighter shadе
Needed to rise from the lowest place
There's silver lining that surrounds the grey
When I get lost, will you come back around?
Things don't look up when you're goin' down
I know your arms, they are reachin' out
From somewhere beyond the clouds
You make me feel
Like my troubled heart is a million miles away
You make me feel
Like I'm drunk on stars and we're dancing out in the space
We were made to be nothin' more than this

Pulling hair out, wear you out, you exhausted

Findin' magic in all the smallest things
The way we notice, that's what really matters
Let's make tonight go on and on and on
 We were made to be nothin' more than this
Findin' magic in all the smallest things
 The way we notice, that's what really matters
Let's make tonight go on and on and on
You make me feel
Like my troubled heart is a million miles away
You make me feel
Like I'm drunk on stars and we're dancing out in the space
We were made to be nothin' more than this
Findin' magic in all the smallest things 
The way we notice, that's what really matters is
Make tonight go on and on and on
Anything she needs, she can call me
Don't worry 'bout her, that's my seed, yup, that's all me

So come on, and let it go
Oh, I think that you should know
That she ain't messin' with no other man
Now, what you not gon' do
Is stand there, 'cross from me, like you got kung-fu
Death stare, cross arm, runnin' your mouth like a faucet
But you don't know that my girl been doin' CrossFit
Pew, kung pow, hit your ass with a cross kick
Pulling hair out, wear you out, you exhausted
Know she gonna slide anytime you bitches talk shit
Keep a lil' blade in her fuckin' lip gloss kit, ayy
No one say hi to me without her
Better pay your respect to the queen
Better do that shit without a flirt
Gotta respect the HBIC
Couple of things that you need to know
If you still wanna be friends with me
Just know if you cross her, then you cross me
Cross me, cross me, if you, if you, if you, if you
If you cross her
Then you cross me
And nobody's comin' close, yeah
And I think that you should know that
If you cross her
Then you cross me

Can you pull the curtains? Let me see the sunshine
I think I'm done with my hidin' place and you found me anyway
It's been forever, but I'm feelin' alright
Tears dry and will leave no trace and tomorrow's another day
Hide and seek, I am somewhere closed away
You won't believe how long it's been since I started the game
I can't be seen and you won't find me today
I've not been this low, but I'll be okay
"Are you alright?" Maybe don't ask
'Cause you know I never like to talk about that
Keep it inside, yeah, you say I always hold back
And I always wear long sleeves
Is it in your childhood? Somethin' happen in your past?
Well, the sadness, yeah, I promise that it won't last
And if I could, I would try to take it all back
There's still more underneath and that's when you say to me
"Can you pull the curtains? Let me see the sunshine
I think I'm done with my hidin' place and you found me anyway
It's been forever, but I'm feelin' alright
Tears dry and will leave no trace and tomorrow's another day"
Let me see the sunshine, shine, shine
Let me see the sunshine
Hide and seek, count to ten and close your eyes
Try to breathe, see a message and don't reply
Nice to meet, but in reality, say goodbye
Life can be so beautiful if you try
"Are you okay?" Yeah, I guess so
But on some days, I feel like I'm trapped in a hole
But I keep quiet, so the ones around me don't know
That the mountain feels so steep
And I'll say that I'm here to help to carry the load
And the outside rays, they are good for the soul
So, let's step out of the dark 'cause, in here, it's so cold
The day's not out of reach and that's when you say to me
"Can you pull the curtains? Let me see the sunshine
I think I'm done with my hidin' place and you found me anyway
It's been forever but I'm feelin' alright
Tears dry and will leave no trace and tomorrow's another day"
Let me see the sunshine, shine, shine
Let me see the sunshine

>>>Dive Ed Sheeran

Oh, maybe I came on too strong
Maybe I waited too long
Maybe I played my cards wrong
Oh, just a little bit wrong
Baby, I apologize for it
I could fall or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hangin' on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And jumpin' in harder than
Ten thousand rocks on the lake
So don't call me "baby"
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So, let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
I have travelled the world
And there's no other girl like you
No one, what's your history? 
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?
'Cause I heard you do, mmm
I could fall or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hangin' on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And lie awake every day
Don't know how much I can take
So don't call me "baby"
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So, let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
Mm, I could fall or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hangin' on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
Sittin' back, lookin' at
Every mess that I made
So don't call me "baby"
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
And let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you

>>>Don't Ed Sheeran
<sos>
I met this girl late last year
She said, "Don't you worry if I disappear"
I told her, "I'm not really looking for another mistake"
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only lookin' for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, "I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM"
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singin'
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
And for a couple weeks, I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before, a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's stayin' at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missin' it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissin' him, how I was confused about
Now, she should figure it out while I'm sat here singing
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was cryin' on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next 
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat 
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were stayin' on the same **** hotel floor
And I wasn't lookin' for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late, if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singin'
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that, babe
Don't **** with my love
I told her, she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that, babe

>>>Drunk Ed Sheeran
<sos>
I wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And never an excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didn't kill me, it never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your makeup lipsticks to me
So now, I'll maybe lean back there
I'm sat here, wishin' I was sober
I know I'll never hold you like I used to
But our house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold, I'll be freezin'
Can't rely on my heart to beat it
'Cause you take part of it every evenin'
Take words out of my mouth just from breathin'
Replace with phrases like, "When you leavin' me?"
Should I? Should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love
I wanna hold your heart in both hands
Not watch you fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can
And I got no plans for the weekend
So should we speak then? Keep it between friends?
Though I know you'll never love me like you used to
There may be other people like us
We'll see the flicker of the clipper when they light up
Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before
You don't hold me anymore
On cold days, cold plays out like the band's name
I know I can't heal things with a handshake
You know I can't change, as I began saying
You cut me wide open like a landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make
Should I? Should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love
You know I'll never change
I'm just drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love

>>>Eraser Ed Sheeran
<sos>
I was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon that kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride
You know that I've got whisky with white lies and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become
Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Show me the locked doors, I'll find another use for the key
I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
But with that said, give me one more
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here, I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of all evil and fame is hell
Relationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun
Please know that I'm not tryna preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become
Have conversations with my father on the A14
Age twelve, telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me
With my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowd's 240 thou'
I may have grown up, but I hope that Damian's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate, but keep erasin' it now
I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said, give me one more
Another one to take the sting away
Oh, I am happy on my own, so here, I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
But my heart will stay the same
Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser

>>>Everything Has Changed Ed Sheeran

All I knew this morning when I woke
Is I know something now
Know something now I didn't before
And all I've seen since 18 hours ago
Is green eyes and freckles and your smile
In the back of my mind, making me feel like
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
And everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed
And all my walls stood tall, painted blue
And I'll take 'em down, take 'em down
And open up the door for you
And all I feel in my stomach is butterflies
The beautiful kind, making up for lost time
Taking flight, making me feel right
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
And everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed
Come back and tell me why
I'm feeling like I've missed you all this time
And meet me there tonight
And let me know that it's not all in my mind
I just wanna know you better
Know you better, know you better now
I just wanna know you, know you, know you
'Cause all I know is we said, "Hello"
And your eyes look like coming home
All I know is a simple name
And everything has changed
All I know is you held the door
You'll be mine and I'll be yours
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed
All I know is we said, "Hello"
So dust off your highest hopes
All I know is pouring rain
And everything has changed
All I know is a new found grace
All my days, I'll know your face
All I know since yesterday
Is everything has changed

Yo, Jam, this is a letter to you
It's been a while, but it's been hard for me to get in the booth
And since we last spoke, I've become a father of two
Tryna live life with a smile, but that's been harder to do
'Cause all I wanna do is talk about you
But these tears won't let me talk about you
We should've known that we'd be lost without you
Therapy sessions, diggin' deep in depression
I got a life full of blessings, but this just breaks my fuckin' heart
At your birthday, couldn't even crack a smile
I just cried and left the party, Neesh, I'll see you in while
Headed to the mural, got some jerk wings and plantain
'Cause that is the way that me and you would celebrate it
I never knew you touched the stuff, 'cause you'd always bad me up
If you saw me more than drunk, you always hated what it does
Before Lyra, I just stopped, I haven't even wanted one
I can't get over this, it's fucked, man, I wished I'd known
And yo, we cried for nine nights in your family home
Laid you to rest in the ground but without a stone
You know it hits me most at moments now when I'm alone
Every morning, I remember that you're really gone
'Cause it's been a long night and I cry 'cause I miss my brother
You know for life, got your sis and mother
And day and night, it still hits that you're gone
And right now I'm spillin' tears in my cup
You left the world 'fore you met Jupiter
Wish you'd have known you would be godfather
You would've loved lovin' my little girls
If not for them, I'd be done with the world
Was there two hours after you passed
Speedin' east to west, silent in the back of the car
Was at your mum's, there all week, tryna make sense but I can't
And although it's been a year, still feel the pain in my heart
'Cause you were there from the start
The day we met, yeah, I moved in and we were never apart
People assumed that we were lovers, but we're brothers in arms
Symbiotic bond of love and gave each other a chance, my god, ah
Lately I've been cryin' so much, my lungs ache
Teardrops all over my shirt like blood stains
And I know to heal a heart, it must break
But I'm done prayin', they
Gave me a shovel at your burial
And watchin' you get lowered is somethin' I can't forget at all
And people find and stop me in the street and say it's terrible
But they don't know you like I knew you and they never will
No one saw the nights turn into day when we were battle rappin'
No one saw the belly laugh, and every train to somewhere random
No one saw the holidays, and then our first experience clubbin'
No one knew the things you did for me and never asked for nothin'
No one read the conversations of the moves that we were plannin'
No one knew about the way you felt the scene, left you abandoned
No one knew about your fears 'cause you would hide 'em with a smile
No one knew when people took an inch, you would give 'em a mile
'Cause that was always Jamal, SB to the crowd
They used to shout your net worth, but they don't mention it now
They hear about your good deeds and infectious smile
A golden heart that's still remembered is worth more than a crown
I promised sixty-four bars and now I keep it to Tanisha
Mummy, Isaac, the gang, but I just wish that you'd seen it
I can't accept that you're gone, or the grief that I'm feeling
I prayed to God for answers, but He still won't give me a reason
I think about you every day, nothing will take this pain away
I'll keep your legacy amazin', mate
The conversations at your grave's the only way to be close
I know you'll greet me with a smile on the day that I go
'Cause it's been a long night and I cry 'cause I miss my brother
And for life, got your sis and mother
You know I cry 'cause I miss my brother
My brother was SBTV

I thought it'd feel different playin' Wembley
Eighty thousand singin' with me
It's what I've been chasin' 'cause this is the dream
When it was all over, I cleared out the room
Grabbed a couple beers, just me and you
Then we started talking the way that we do
Ain't it funny how the simplest things in life can make a man?
Little moments that pass us by
Oh, but I remember
The first kiss, the first night, the first song that made you cry
The first drink, red wine, on a step in Brooklyn
I still feel the first fight and we both made it out alive
And I can't wait to make a million more first times
The greatest thing that I have achieved
Was four little words, down on one knee
You said, "Darling, are you jokin'?", and I just said, "Please"
Ain't it funny how the simplest things in life can make a man?
Little moments that pass us by
Oh, but I remember
The first kiss, the first night, the first song that made you cry
The first look in your eyes when I said "I love you"
I can still feel the butterflies from when we stumbled home that night
I can't wait to make a million more first times
Ain't it funny how the simplest things in life can make a man?
Little moments that pass us by
Oh, but I remember
The first kiss, first night, first song that made you cry
First dance in moonlight in your parents' garden
I can't wait to see everything that's yet to be
Our first child and then a million more first times
<eos>

Whenever I'm lonely, you're there for my soul
Wherever you are, girl, that's where I call my home
Whenever you doubt it, I'll be lеttin' you know
Woah, girl, I want to be dancin' with you forever
You see through thе storm and take me as I am

Hold you for my hand, my hand, hand
Hold you for my hand, hold you for my hand
Over and over again, yeah, my love is burning, baby
Feels like time is frozen and the night is for us
And we're alone again and every moment's golden, yeah
Feelings I've been holding in, it must be love
Whenever I'm broken, you make me feel whole 
Whenever I'm lonely, you're there for my soul 
Wherever you are, girl, that's where I call my home
Whenever you doubted, I'll be lettin' you know
Woah, girl, I want to be dancin' with you forever
You see through the storm and take me as I am
Baby, it's magic any time that we're together

Hold you for my hand, my hand, hand
Hold you for my hand, hold you for my hand
Hold you for my hand, my hand, hand
Hold you for my hand, hold you for my hand

She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just wanna dance"
I met her on Grafton Street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you wanna drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just wanna dance"
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room, swear she was singing to me
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just wanna dance"
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just wanna dance"
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl

Walkin' down 29th and Park
I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said somethin' to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're movin' on with someone new
'Cause, baby, you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then, I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursin' an empty bottle and tellin' myself
You're happier, aren't you?
Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
But, my darlin', I am still in love with you
But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
'Cause, baby, you look happier, you do
I knew one day you'd fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I'll be waitin' here for you
<eos>
>>>Hearts Don't Break Around Here Ed Sheeran
<sos>
She is the sweetest thing that I know
Should see the way she holds me when the lights go low
Shakes my soul like a pothole every time
Took my heart upon a one way trip
Guess she went wandering off with it
And unlike most women I know
This one will bring it back whole
Daisies, daisies perched upon your forehead
Oh, my baby, lately I know
That every night, I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
"Oh, we're in love, aren't we?"
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
She is the river flow in Orwell
And tin wind chimes used for doorbells, ah
Fields and trees and her smell fill my lungs
Spend my summertime beside her
And the rest of the year, the same
She is the flint that sparks the lighter
And the fuel that will hold the flame, oh
Roses, roses laid upon your bed spread, oh my
Oh, this, oh, this I know
But every night, I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
"Oh, we're in love, aren't we?"
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Well, I found love hidden inside
The arms of a woman I know
She is the lighthouse in the night
That will safely guide me home
And I'm not scared of passing over
Or the thought of growing old
'Cause from now until I go
Every night I’ll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
"Oh, we're in love, aren't we?"
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Every night, I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
"Oh, we're in love, aren't we?"
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

>>>How Would You Feel Ed Sheeran
<sos>
You are the one, girl
And you know that it's true
Every time that I'm alone with you
We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask, but
How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too
As the lilacs bloom
Love flows deeper than the river
Every moment that I spend with you
We were sat upon our best friend's roof
I had both of my arms around you
Watching the sunrise replace the moon, but
How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too
Yeah, we were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask
How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Falling deeper in love with you
Tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too
<eos>
>>>Hush Little Baby Ed Sheeran
<sos>
Hush little baby don't you cry
I said hush little baby don't you cry
I'm saying hush little baby don't you cry
Daddy ain't sure if he can raise you right
I ain't even good with saving my money
Why should I think I can save your life?
And the whole family's gonna think I'm a devil, I don't wanna see my angels eyes
I say this with one hand on my heart, guilt ain't gonna make me change my mind
My first thoughts, were the worst thoughts, running 'round my head in circles
The worlds gonna hate me for saying this, but patience is a virtue
So we don't have to rush for our first youth, we can take time do rehearsals
And I ain't acting this is personal, and I ain't doing this just to hurt you
I should say goodbye, before I say hello
So darling hold me, closely, tonight
Because if you open your eyes, I'll never let you go
Moving slowly, we'll both sleep tonight
And we'll just be dreaming 'til you wake me up
When I'm telling her about raving
She's telling me about cravings
I want her to just get the message
I don't wanna have to be so blatant
So I told her my life ain't balanced
Yeah, said the time ain't right
She said god's clock's the only one that matters
And it's about time I tried, yeah and if I listen to my family
Then they'll be a new addition to my family
I can't help feeling peer pressured, everybody's looking down but they don't understand me
And everyone's so suggestive, I'm getting mixed messages, but nobody's rang me
Huh, I'm saying this ain't a game, but I say the wrong thing and everyone wants to hang me
I should say goodbye, before I say hello
So darling hold me, closely, tonight
Because if you open your eyes, I'll never let you go
Moving slowly, we'll both sleep tonight
And we'll just be dreaming 'til you wake me up
Hush little baby don't you cry
I said hush little baby don't you cry
I said hush little baby don't you cry, no
I said hush little baby don't you cry
I should say goodbye, before I say hello
So darling hold me, closely, tonight
Because if you open your eyes, I'll never let you go
Moving slowly, we'll both sleep tonight
And we'll just be dreaming 'til you wake me up

>>>I Don't Care Ed Sheeran
<sos>
I'm at a party I don't wanna be at
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie, yeah
Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back
Nobody's even lookin' me in my eyes
Then you take my hand
Finish my drink, say, "Shall we dance?" 
You know I love ya, did I ever tell ya?
You make it better like that
Don't think I fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say 
I always feel like I'm nobody, mmm
Who wants to fit in anyway?
'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
We at a party we don't wanna be at
Tryna talk, but we can't hear ourselves
Read your lips, I'd rather kiss 'em right back
With all these people all around
I'm crippled with anxiety
But I'm told it's where I'm s'posed to be
You know what? It's kinda crazy 'cause I really don't mind
When you make it better like that
Don't think we fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say, oh yeah, yeah
When we walked in, I said I'm sorry, mmm
But now I think that we should stay
'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
Yeah, you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights when I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

>>>I See Fire Ed Sheeran
<sos>
Oh, misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons
If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Callin' out, Father, oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside high
And if we should die tonight, we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Callin' out, Father, oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky
Now, I see fire inside the mountain
I see fire burnin' the trees
And I see fire hollowin' souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you'll remember me
Oh, should my people fall then surely, I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls, we got too close to the flame
Callin' out, Father, oh, hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountainside
Desolation comes upon the sky
Now, I see fire inside the mountain
I see fire burnin' the trees
And I see fire hollowin' souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you'll remember me
And if the night is burning, I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns, then my brothers will die
And as the sky's fallin' down, it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground, I hear my people screamin' out
Now, I see fire inside the mountains
I see fire burnin' the trees
I see fire hollowin' souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
I see fire 
And I see fire 
And I see fire
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountain side

>>>I Was Made for Loving You Ed Sheeran
<sos>
A dangerous plan, just this time
A stranger's hand clutched in mine
I'll take this chance, so call me blind
I've been waiting all my life
Please don't scar this young heart
Just take my hand
I was made for loving you
Even though we may be hopeless hearts just passing through
Every bone screaming I don't know what we should do
All I know is, darling, I was made for loving you
Hold me close through the night
Don't let me go, we'll be alright
Touch my soul and hold it tight
I've been waiting all my life
I won't scar your young heart
Just take my hand
'Cause I was made for loving you
Even though we may be hopeless hearts just passing through
Every bone screaming I don't know what we should do
All I know is, darling, I was made for loving you
Please don't go, I've been waiting so long
Oh, you don't even know me at all
But I was made for loving you
I was made for loving you
Even though we may be hopeless hearts just passing through
Every bone screaming I don't know what we should do
All I know is, darling, I was made for loving you
<eos>
>>>I'm a Mess Ed Sheeran
<sos>
Oh, I'm a mess right now, inside out
Searching for a sweet surrender, but this is not the end
I can't work it out, how?
Going through the motions, going through us
And, oh, I've known it for the longest time
And all of my hopes, all of my words
Are all over written on the signs
When you're on my road walkin' me home
Home, home, home, home
See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright, I wanna feel your love, no
Easy, baby, maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight, I wanna fall in love
And put your faith in my stomach
I messed up this time, late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion with fingers intertwined
I can't shake this feeling now
We're going through the motions, hopin' you'd stop
And, oh, I've only caused you pain, you know
But all of my words will always be low
Of all, all the love we spoke
When you're on my road walkin' me home
Home, home, home, home
See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright, I wanna feel your love, no
Easy, baby, maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight, I wanna fall in love
And put your faith in my stomach
And for how long I love my lover?
For how long I love my lover now, now?
For how long, long I love my lover now, now?
For how long, long I love my lover now, now? 
For how long, long I love my lover now, now?
For how long I love my lover now, now?
For how long, long I love my lover?

>>>If I Could Ed Sheeran
<sos>
The life I live is a fast one
But even if I’m getting whole-pies, I would halve some
Course I think im top of the sport I do bar-none
Won't change a thing and I can still have a chart run, still be a gargon
You grow up as a kid; you’re looking up to your older
And then you lose respect because you see what they show ya
I wish I didn't have to be the one that they looked to
I don't condone the war that the young ones are put through
Things have changed now but I come from the hood too
People say they never see me there but im hood dude
Say the word lemon, I’ll be there with the good food
Certain man you see and they are not in a good mood
I just let the world go by and I’ll pace it
If I draw a good picture then another can trace it
Mother dropped me in the world only for me to grace it
I’m gona leave my mark on this earth place it, advanced not basic
If I could, I would change
Life’s a battle I’m only one somebody I can only do so much
And even I ain’t worry but I still stay strong
I am the only one, ohh
I tell them no man is an island, well you will think we are but I’m breaking the silence
I wanna see us all on one time
But if I’m on the bill then someone gotta spit one rhyme
What they tryna do is light the show with me one sign
Can't help the world will your only one mind, only got one life
If you dont reverse and take it serious; one mic
Deny you of your legacy and they ain’t got one right
Well I record a batch of nine tracks in one night
I work through the hours and then I meet with the sunlight
I know I got power but I’m tryin to channel it
I know that we can make the music, money, and manage it
Even starting from the floor I’ll find the flow and unravel it
Every time I watch the news blud its making me sad a bit
I really need to change the channel over to happy vibes
N-dubz, fazer, tulisa, dappy vibes
Whoevers in the lime-light’s got a good apetite
I rate ya, how am I gona hate ya? Harry right, huh

>>>The Joker and the Queen Ed Sheeran
<sos>
How was I to know? It's a crazy thing
I showed you my hand and you still let me win
And who was I to say that this was meant to be?
The road that was broken brought us together
And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would give you a diamond ring
When I fold, you see the best in me
The joker and the queen
I was upside down from the outside in
You came to the table and you went all in
With a single word and a gentle touch
You turned a moment into forever
And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that could give you a diamond ring
When I fold, you see the best in me
The joker and the queen
And I know you could fall for a thousand kings
And hearts that would givе you a diamond ring
When I folded, you saw the bеst in me
The joker and the queen
The joker and the queen

>>>Lego House Ed Sheeran
<sos>
I'm gonna pick up the pieces
And build a LEGO house
If things go wrong, we can knock it down
My three words have two meanings
But there's one thing on my mind
It's all for you
And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken, I'll mend ya
And I'll keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're gettin' down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm gonna paint you by numbers
And colour you in
If things go right, we can frame it
And put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it
But I've been here before
Now, I'll surrender up my heart
And swap it for yours
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're gettin' down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done

>>>Life Goes On Ed Sheeran
<sos>
It hit like a train, I ran out of words
I got nothin' to say, everything hurts
And I know love leads to pain
But memories serve our sweetest refrain, mmm
The waves came tumblin' down
As you float away, I'm reachin' for ya
To tell me how, how my life goes on with you gone
I suppose I'll sink like a stone
If you leave me now, oh, the storms will roll
Easy come, hard go, then life goes on
Would I miss the flames, the heated reserve?
Oh, I'd remember thе way that you put me first
And what a heart-wrenchin' shamе
That you'll never know, just like tears in the rain, mmm
A constant grey in the clouds
When I hear your name, I think of love
So, tell me how, how my life goes on with you gone
I suppose I'll sink like a stone
If you leave me now, oh, the storms will roll
Easy come, hard go, then life goes on
Ah, yeah, life goes on
I watched the sun setting down
I am so afraid, I need you now
To tell me how, how my life goes on with you gone
I suppose I'll sink like a stone
If you leave me now, oh, the storms will roll
Easy come, hard go, then life goes on
Easy come, hard go, then life goes on

>>>Make It Rain Ed Sheeran
<sos>
When the sins of my father
Weigh down in my soul
And the pain of my mother
Will not let me go
Well, I know there can come fire from the sky
To refine the purest of kings
And even though I know this fire brings me pain
Even so, and just the same
Make it rain down, lord
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Well, a seed needs the water
'Fore it grows out of the ground
But it just keeps on getting hard
Well, I know they can't count tears from the eye
But they may as well all be in vain
And even though I know these tears come with pain
Even so, and just the same
Make it rain down, lord
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Just make it rain
Well, the seas are full of water
Stops by the shore
It's like the riches of grandeur, oh no
Never reach the poor
And let the clouds fill with thunderous applause
And let lightning be the veins
But fill the sky with all that they can draw
When it's time to make a change
Make it rain down, lord
Oh, make it rain
Make it rain down, lord
Oh, make it rain
Oh, make it rain

>>>The Man Ed Sheeran
<sos>
Now, I don't wanna hate you
Just wish you'd never gone for the man
And waited two weeks, at least
Before you'd let him take you
I stayed true, kind of knew
You liked the dude from private school
He's waiting for the time to move
I knew he had his eyes on you
He's not the right guy for you
Don't hate me 'cause I write the truth
No, I would never lie to you
But it was never fine to lose you
And what a way to find out
It never came from my mouth
You never changed your mind
But you were just afraid to mind out
I won't be changing the subject, I love it
I'll make your little secret public
It's nothing, I'm just disgusted with the skeletons
You sleep with in your closet to get back at me
Trapped and I'm lacking sleep
Fact is you're mad at me
Because I backtrack so casually
You're practically my family
If we married then I'll guess you'd have to be
But tragically, our love just lost the will to live
But would it kill to give it one more shot?
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't want you, no
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't wanna love you, no
Recently, I'll tend to zone out
Up in my headphones to Holocene
You promised your body but I'm away so much
I stay more celibate than in a monastery
I'm not cut out for life on the road
'Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much
And at the time, we'd just go, so sue me
I guess I'm not the man that you need
Ever since you went to uni'
I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack
Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad
But when I broke the industry
That's when I broke your heart
I was supposed to chart and celebrate
But good things are over fast
I know it's hard to deal with and see this
I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features
Then I turn the music off
And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus
I never really want to believe this
Got advice from my dad and he
Told me that family is all I'll ever have and need
I guess I'm unaware of it
Success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't want you, no
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't wanna love you, no
And since you left, I've given up my days off
It's what I need to stay strong
I know you have a day job but mine is 24/7
I feel like writing a book, I guess I lied in the hook
'Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could
The irony is if my career in music didn't exist
In 6 years, yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid
I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink
And lighting a spliff, I fall into a spiral and it's
Just hiding my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill
And I'll be writing my will before I'm 27, I'll die from a thrill
Go down in history as just a wasted talent
Can I face the challenge, or did I make a mistake erasing ****?
It's only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me
Eventually, I'll be fine, I know that it was never meant to be
Either way, I guess I'm not prepared, but I'll say this
These things happen for a reason and you can't change ****
Take my apology, I'm sorry for the honesty
But I had to get this off my chest
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't want you, no
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't wanna love you, no
>>>Merry Christmas Ed Sheeran
<sos>
Now, I don't wanna hate you
Just wish you'd never gone for the man
And waited two weeks, at least
Before you'd let him take you
I stayed true, kind of knew
You liked the dude from private school
He's waiting for the time to move
I knew he had his eyes on you
He's not the right guy for you
Don't hate me 'cause I write the truth
No, I would never lie to you
But it was never fine to lose you
And what a way to find out
It never came from my mouth
You never changed your mind
But you were just afraid to mind out
I won't be changing the subject, I love it
I'll make your little secret public
It's nothing, I'm just disgusted with the skeletons
You sleep with in your closet to get back at me
Trapped and I'm lacking sleep
Fact is you're mad at me
Because I backtrack so casually
You're practically my family
If we married then I'll guess you'd have to be
But tragically, our love just lost the will to live
But would it kill to give it one more shot?
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't want you, no
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't wanna love you, no
Recently, I'll tend to zone out
Up in my headphones to Holocene
You promised your body but I'm away so much
I stay more celibate than in a monastery
I'm not cut out for life on the road
'Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much
And at the time, we'd just go, so sue me
I guess I'm not the man that you need
Ever since you went to uni'
I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack
Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad
But when I broke the industry
That's when I broke your heart
I was supposed to chart and celebrate
But good things are over fast
I know it's hard to deal with and see this
I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features
Then I turn the music off
And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus
I never really want to believe this
Got advice from my dad and he
Told me that family is all I'll ever have and need
I guess I'm unaware of it
Success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't want you, no
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't wanna love you, no
And since you left, I've given up my days off
It's what I need to stay strong
I know you have a day job but mine is 24/7
I feel like writing a book, I guess I lied in the hook
'Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could
The irony is if my career in music didn't exist
In 6 years, yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid
I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink
And lighting a spliff, I fall into a spiral and it's
Just hiding my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill
And I'll be writing my will before I'm 27, I'll die from a thrill
Go down in history as just a wasted talent
Can I face the challenge, or did I make a mistake erasing ****?
It's only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me
Eventually, I'll be fine, I know that it was never meant to be
Either way, I guess I'm not prepared, but I'll say this
These things happen for a reason and you can't change ****
Take my apology, I'm sorry for the honesty
But I had to get this off my chest
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't want you, no
I don't love you, baby
I don't need you, baby
I don't wanna love you, no
Build the fire and gather 'round the tree
Fill the glass and maybe come and sing with me
So kiss me under the mistletoe
Pour out the wine, let's toast and pray for December snow
I know there's been pain this year, but it's time to let it go
Next year, you never know
But for now, Merry Christmas, we'll
Dance in the kitchen while embers glow
We've both known love, but this love we got is the bеst of all
I wish you could see you through my eyes, then you would know
My God, you look bеautiful
Right now, Merry Christmas
The fire is raging on
And we'll all sing along to the song
Just having so much fun
While we're here, can we all
Spare a thought for the ones who have gone?
So just keep kissin' me under the mistletoe
Pour out the wine, let's toast and pray for December snow
I know there's been pain this year, but it's time to let it go
Next year, you never know
But for now, Merry Christmas, we'll
Dance in the kitchen while embers glow
We've both known love, but this love we got is the best of all
I wish you could see you through my eyes, then you would know
My God, you look beautiful
Right now, Merry Christmas
I feel it when it comes
Every year helpin' us carry on
Filled up with so much love
All our family and friends
Are together where we all belong
It's Christmas time for you and I
We'll have a good night and a Merry Christmas
It's Christmas time for you and I
We'll have a good night and a Merry Christmas
It's Christmas time for you and I
We'll have a good night and a Merry Christmas
It's Christmas time for you and I
We'll have a good night and a Merry Christmas time

>>>My G Ed Sheeran
<sos>
No other name for you
Even though they call you by another, you were always my G
And you light up the room
Ever since the first day you were here, you were always my G
And if the world is cruel
I will be the last one standin' here to protect you
Don't grow up too soon 
From now and till forever, you were always my G
You probably won't even understand this
So I'ma try and paint the picture on a canvas
Just wanna tell you you won't ever get abandoned
Can't lie, I started writin' and got anxious
But you'rе my biggest blessin', what a life that I'vе been granted
One in a million, couldn't try it if we planned it
Don't mind me, just fly free, you're my G
Shit ain't easy, this a different type of love 
Every time we greet, you get a different kind of hug
All the memories that we keep, you and me could write a book
And we're still not done, you're my G till time is up
Out in public, you walk past them, they might look
Keep smilin', baby girl, and watch the day gon' brighten up
Know I'm still with ya, I'd kill for ya if someone tried their luck
Can't even sip my drink, I'm spillin' tears inside my cup
Knew you were special from the minute you was born
Unidentical twin, but so different from 'em all
So happy when I met you and your sister on the ward
You know big bro's here to come and lift you if you fall
I know Hat'll take care of you when I am gone
That's my angel, she'll be stable until I am one
I wish Tony seen you's grow, but shit, we ride on
Lookin' back at old pictures, where's the time gone?
No other name for you
Even though they call you by another, you were always my G
And you light up the room
Ever since the first day you were here, you were always my G
And if the world is cruel
I will be the last one standin' here to protect you 
Don't grow up too soon 
From now and till forever, you were always my G
Heart broke when I found out there's a hole in yours
Had me stressed out for weeks, but I cope of course
No way you would've left us, you was three months old
You got a long life ahead of you, I know there's more
To make you happy is what I'm hopin' for
Can have anything you want, I took an oath, I swore
Baby, live your best life, you shouldn't grow by force
All in your own time, G, the globe is yours
Yeah, you got us wearin' odd socks on the twenty-first
People laugh, but we're too strong for it to ever hurt
They might try and bring you down, but it'll never work
When you smile, you just light up the room
I ain't never met a person that's brighter than you
Say "I love you," and I mean it every time that I do
You little shit, you got me cryin' in the booth
Tryna do Mum proud, tryna do Dad proud
Tryna do you proud, tryna do Hat proud
Swear I'm tryin', five years I ain't sat down
And all I've heard is your voice in the background
Don't say a word before you chat, I just know it
If I answer FaceTime, you gon' ask me where Joe is
Swear to God, you're just amazing, little girl
From the bottom of my heart, I wouldn't change it for the world, yeah
No other name for you
Even though they call you by another, you were always my G
And you light up the room
Ever since the first day you were here, you were always my G
And if the world is cruel
I will be the last one standin' here to protect you
Don't grow up too soon
From now and till forever, you were always my G
No other name for you
Ever since the first day you were here, you were always my G
And you light up the room 
Don't grow up too soon 
From now and till forever, you were always my G

>>>Nancy Mulligan Ed Sheeran

I was twenty-four years old
When I met the woman I would call my own
Twenty-two grand kids now growing old
In that house that your brother bought ya
On the summer day when I proposed
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold
And I asked her father, but her daddy said, "No
You can't marry my daughter"
She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border
Well, I met her at Guy's in the second World War
And she was working on a soldier's ward
Never had I seen such beauty before
The moment that I saw her
Nancy was my yellow rose
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes
We got eight children now growing old
Five sons and three daughters
She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border
From her snow white streak in her jet black hair
Over sixty years I've been loving her
Now we're sat by the fire in our old armchairs
You know Nancy, I adore ya
From a farm boy born near Belfast town
I never worried 'bout the king and crown
'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground
There's no difference, I assure ya
She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border

>>>New Man Ed Sheeran
<sos>
I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet
And I hear he's on a new diet and watches what he eats
He's got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me
But still, I'm just keepin' it real
Still lookin' at your Instagram and I'll be creepin' a lil'
I'll be tryin' not to double tap from way back
'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at
Let me remind you of the days when
You used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
I guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn't Superman
Just a young boy tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya
I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
Your new man rents a house in the 'burb
And wears a man bag on his shoulder, but I call it a purse
Every year, he goes to Málaga with all the fellas
Drinks beer, but has a six pack, I'm kinda jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors, in winter, at nighttime
And every time a rap song comes on, he makes a gun sign
Says "Chune, bwoydem light up the room!"
But enough about him, girl, let's talk about you
You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin'
Eatin' a packet of crisps, but you will never find you cheatin'
Now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym
Keepin' up with Kylie and Kim
In the back of the club, kissin' a boy that ain't him
Okay, you need to be alone
And if you wanna talk about it, you can call my phone
I just thought I would tell you, 'cause you oughta know
You're still a young girl tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya
I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
Baby, I'm not tryin' to ruin your week
But you act so differently
When you're with him, I know you're lonely
Please remember you're still free
To make the choice and leave
Don't call me up, you need to show me
I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about
I don't wanna know about your new man

>>>Nina Ed Sheeran

I met you when I was a teen but then you were one as well
And I could play a guitar just like ringing a bell
Sometimes, I wonder, in any other summer
Could you have been my part-time lover to me listening to Stevie Wonder?
Under the covers where we used to lay
And "Re: Stacks" is what the speakers played
I'd be on tour almost every day
When I was home, up in my flat is where we used to stay
Just watching a DVD, smoking illegal weed
Getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe
We used each other's air just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
We go anywhere our minds would take us
And I'll say you are beautiful without your make-up
And you don’t even need to worry 'bout your weight 'cause
We can all be loved the way that God made us
And time's the only reason that we could break up
'Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes
To get on a plane or make a mistake, so say it again
You should go, Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now?
And I've been living on the road, Nina
But then again, you should know, Nina
'Cause that’s you and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?
And every weekend in the winter, you'd be wearing my hoodie
With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold
Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own
'Cause every day when I was away, we'd only speak on the phone
Watching Blue Planet, creating new habits
Acting as if we were two rabbits and then, you'd vanish
Back to the burrow with all the Celtics
I disappear, you call me selfish
I understand but I can’t help it
I put my job over everything 'cept my family and friends
But you'll be in between forever so I guess we'll have to take a step back
'Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And I'm not saying we should be taking a break
Just re-evaluate quick before we make a mistake and it’s too late
So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane
But in a day, we'll have to say it again
You should go, Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now?
And I've been living on the road, Nina
But then again, you should know, Nina
'Cause that’s you and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?
Love will come and love will go
But you can't make it on your own
Sing that song, go
Oh, won't you leave me now?
People grow and fall apart
But you can't mend your broken heart
Take it back, go
Oh, won't you leave me now?
You should go, Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now?
And I've been living on the road, Nina
But then again, you should know, Nina
'Cause that’s you and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?
You should go, Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now?
And I've been living on the road, Nina
But then again, you should know, Nina
'Cause that’s you and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?
>>>Nothing on You Ed Sheeran
<sos>
I feel it, can you feel it tonight?
I feel the fire between you and I
I mean it, don't you turn off the light
Though I don't wanna leave you ever, no
She was like "Damn¨
Boy, I never took you for a one night stand
So don't make plans
For nothing but me and a lil' romance," hey
You and I, whiskey on ice
Maybe later we can turn down all the lights
So keep 'em on with nothing on
I was rolling up something with you
Kickin' back in a way that we do
I got everything I need in this room
Smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
And all my friends are in the club
And they keep ringin' my phone 
But they ain't got nothing on you 
And you ain't got nothing on you 
Mami, suelo acobardarme pero hoy tomo alcohol, ah
Quiero comentarle que no sé qué pasó, ah
Desde que salimo' por la tarde lo' do'
A besarno' lo' do', hasta hacer el amor
Ahora tengo tu olor, ven a la habitación
Lo que hacemo' lo' do' no se puede igualar
Parecemo' ficción cuando entramo' en acción
Esta peli de amor no se puede acabar, yeh 
Pero lo que mata e' que esta noche no' vemo' ya en mi casa 
Y sé lo que te gusta y te atrapa
Que te diga que no te voy a soltar
I was rolling up something with you 
Kickin' back in a way that we do
I got everything I need in this room
Smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
And all my friends are in the club
And they keep ringin' my phone 
But they ain't got nothing on you
And you ain't got nothing on you
Look, take the lead, follow me, what's it gonna be?
How you playin' hard to get when you hollered me?
I take Chanel to Chanel for a shopping spree
Home girl, only right she in a proper tee
What I want and need, you and a sofa
I fly in a spaceship, I gotta land the Rover
Casa Cruz, Casa Blanca, Casanova
I'm a fashionista, she in Fashion Nova
And a mad persona when I had her over
The outfit, it cost bread, I got the matching loafers
Why? 'Cause that's suttin' to do
I got a million and two but they're nothin' on you, nah
I was rolling up something with you
Kickin' back in a way that we do
I got everything I need in this room
Smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
And all my friends are in the club
And they keep ringin' my phone 
But they ain't got nothing on you
And you ain't got nothing on you
She was like "Damn¨
Boy, I never took you for a one night stand"
She was like "Damn¨
Boy, I never took you for a one night stand"
Want to be your man
"Boy, I never took you for a one night stand"
She was like "Damn¨
And you ain't got nothing on you

Give me that old school love right now
You know when I hold you, you won’t be alone
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
Give me that late 80s early 90s old school
Feeling like my second album, so cool
Chiraq summer looking so cruel
Look shorty in the eye, told me it was no rules
Went to speak but was like never mind
Let my mind just sneak back to a better time
When I was his age and if he's ever mine
Thinking he would only think back to this and never find
Better times to think back to when it comes
And he's older in the presence of somebody young
Telling him the same things that he told me
And he reacts the same way as that OG
But it's old school, it's like '03
And this old man is my old me
Takes a long time to happen so fast
To realize that your future is somebody else's past
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
Analog black vinyl spinning sounding so good
Top down, can't be a classic if it's no wood
If you don't know what, then you new school
Floor model is the foundation for your YouTubes
Model flows off of Fat Boys and Juice Crews
Melle Mel's, Ice-T's, and the 2 Cools
Add a Moe Dee and a Double L
Had to walk cause it's hard to run in those unbuckled shells
One microphone and a couple 12s
Six drum sounds and a couple bells
Is all you had to make a couple rails
And that's a track, and if you want a 
You have to make it like that
Now what's one turtle to a couple snails?
Takes a long time to happen so fast
And realize your future is somebody else's past
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
Chiraq summer looking so cruel
How can I reel-to-reel when there's Pro Tool?
I can't dig it at all because there's no tube
Fire when you speak but ain't no warmth in your vocals
Might have been a better rhyme then just never mind
If it's better with time then think in line
That you're going to be your nicest 'round your midlife crisis
If you're life like Christ live your midlife like it's... Christ-like
Nigga I ain't psychic
I know it's all a cycle and everybody bike it
And France is enormous you're Lance with endorsements
But you might need a hand to enhance your performance
Consider this a kilogram of encouragement
Teach you how to sneak it past the enforcement
And when you get it through in a manner so cool
Remember to give a little nod to the old school
Give me your old school love right now
I'm leaving it all up to you darling, giving you everything you want
And give me that old school love right now
You know that only you and me alone...
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now
As long as I'm here, as long as you love me
Give me that old school love right now

Tell me that you'll turn down the man
Who asks for your hand
'Cause you're waitin' for me
And I know you're gonna be away a while
But I've got no plans at all to leave
And would you take away my hopes and dreams?
And just stay with me, ooh
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumblin' home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one
Take my hand and my
Heart and soul, I will
Only have these eyes for you
And you know everything changes
But we'll be strangers if we see this through
You could stay within these walls and bleed
Or just stay with me, oh, Lord, now
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumblin' home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one
Stumblin' half-drunk, gettin' myself lost
I am so gone, so tell me the way home
I listen to sad songs, singin' about love
And where it goes wrong
And all my senses come to life
While I'm stumblin' home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
'Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me you'll always be a friend
'Cause you are the only one

>>>Overpass Graffiti Ed Sheeran

This is a dark parade
Another rough patch to rain on
I know your friends may say
This is a cause for celebration
Hip, hip, hooray, love
Photographs in sepia tones
So still, the fire's barely fighting the cold
There are times when I can feel your ghost
Just when I'm almost letting you go
The cards were stacked against us both
I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were
You were the first full-stop love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me
This is a goddamn shame
I never wanted to break it
Know I should walk away
But I just can't replace us
Or even erase us
The car was stuck, the engine stalled
And both of us got caught out in the snow
There were times when I forget the lows
And think the highs were all that we'd ever known
The cards were stacked against us both
I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were
You were the first full-stop love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me
Well, I will always love you for what it's worth
We'll never fade like graffiti on the overpass, yeah
And I know time may change the way you think of us
But I'll remember the way we were
You were the first full-stop love that will never leave
Baby, you will never be lost on me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, graffiti on the overpass

'Cause your body's on fire
Show me how to control it
And go hit your spliff and get higher
Girl, I love how you roll it
I put my hand there, hold it
I'ma be right by ya
Lighters up, lighters up, one time, lighters up
Pulled up in the party, when you saw me, I was lightin' up my J
So go ahead and brighten up my day
Lighters in the air when you lighting up the rave
And it's feelin' like I met you here before 
Girl, I felt your presence when they let you through the door 
Never had a bruddah give you everything and more
So I take a little piece and then the rest of it is yours
E don tey wey I don dey I tell you
But, girl, you think say nah play 
I know no wetin you dey do me
Wey just dey scatter my brain 
Thug lovin' when I put you in your place
I can tell you love it, just by lookin' in your face
It's the way that you wind up your waist, I'm so in awe
Girl you never have to worry 'bout nothing
You know it's all yours, you know you
Girl, you just own it
'Cause your body's on fire
Show me how to control it
And go hit your spliff and get higher
Girl, I love how you roll it
I put my hand there, hold it

Lights down for the one I love
Right now , we never looked better
Forget our friends, girl, I love it when we chill together
And ain't nobody gonna feel what we feel together
She want a kiss, I, I want another one
You got a sick vibe, I wanted more than one
Up to now, nobody knew where I was comin' from
We got the same mind, so I don't wanna waste time
Bring it to me, come by, that's what I need
That's right, kissin' your cheek, one time
I used to love bein' alone , but now I can't stand it
I'm reachin' out my palm  for you to put your hand in 
Girl, you are the one and I don't understand it 
How you lighten up the room with your glow 
'Cause girl, you just-
Own it 
Girl, you just own it 
'Cause your body's on fire 
Show me how to control it
And go hit your spliff and get higher 
Girl, I love how you roll it 
I put my hand there , hold it
I'ma be right by ya

Show me how to control it
And go hit your spliff and get higher
Girl, I love how you roll it
I put my hand there, hold it
I'ma be right by ya
Lighters up, lighters up, one time, lighters up
Pulled up in the party, when you saw me, I was lightin' up my J
So go ahead and brighten up my day
Lighters in the air when you lighting up the rave
And it's feelin' like I met you here before 
Girl, I felt your presence when they let you through the door 
Never had a bruddah give you everything and more
So I take a little piece and then the rest of it is yours
E don tey wey I don dey I tell you
But, girl, you think say nah play 
I know no wetin you dey do me
Wey just dey scatter my brain 
Thug lovin' when I put you in your place
I can tell you love it, just by lookin' in your face
It's the way that you wind up your waist, I'm so in awe
Girl you never have to worry 'bout nothing
You know it's all yours, you know you
Girl, you just own it
'Cause your body's on fire
Show me how to control it
And go hit your spliff and get higher
Girl, I love how you roll it
I put my hand there, hold it
I'ma be right by ya
Lights down for the one I love
Right now , we never looked better
Forget our friends, girl, I love it when we chill together
And ain't nobody gonna feel what we feel together
She want a kiss, I, I want another one
You got a sick vibe, I wanted more than one
Up to now, nobody knew where I was comin' from
We got the same mind, so I don't wanna waste time

Of all the money that e'er I had
I spent it in good company
And all the harm that e'er I've done
Alas, it was to none but me
And all I've done for want of wit
To memory now, I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
Of all the comrades that e'er I had
They are sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had
They would wish me one more day to stay
But since it falls unto my lot
That I should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call
Good night and joy be with you all
A man may drink and not be drunk
A man may fight and not be slain
A man may court a pretty girl
And, perhaps, be welcomed back again
But since it has so ought to be
By a time to rise and a time to fall
Come fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all

I found a love for me
Oh, darlin', just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But, darlin', just kiss me slow
Your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holdin' mine
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darlin', you look perfect tonight
Well, I found a woman stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that, someday, I'll share her home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darlin', just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listenin' to our favourite song
When I saw you in that dress, lookin' so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darlin', you look perfect tonight
Baby, I'm dancin' in the dark with you between my arms
We're barefoot on the grass, oh, listenin' to our favourite song
I have faith in what I see, now I know I have met
An angel in person and she looks perfect
I don't deserve this, you look perfect tonight

Lovin' can hurt, lovin' can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closin'
Hearts are never broken
And time's forever frozen still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer till our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
Wait for me to come home
Lovin' can heal, lovin' can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya
Mm, and it's the only thing we take with us when we die
Mm, we keep this love in this photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closin'
Hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holdin' me closer till our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me
Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Oh, you can fit me
Inside that necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat, where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me
Well, that's okay, baby, only words bleed
Inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth Street
Hearin' you whisper through the phone
"Wait for me to come home"
<eos>
>>>Put It All on Me Ed Sheeran
<sos>
Ooh, I can't wait to get home
I don't know why, but I'm feelin' low
Happened again and I want you to know
Having my woman there is good for my soul
I try to be strong, well, I got demons
So can I lean on you?
I need a strong heart and a soft touch
And you're the one when I want love
It's you and only you who can be takin' away
The shit that I go through each and every day
When I'm alone with you, you make it better again, yeah
Your arms are where I wanna remain
Catch my eye, and she starts to say
Hey, baby, we can dance slowly
My darlin', I'll be all you need, you need
I know it hasn't been your day or week, or week, or week
So put it all on me
Oh, my darlin', put your worries on me
Can't judge you 'cause I feel the same thing
And I'm here for whenever you need, you need, you need
To put it all on me
Love, on me, o-o-on me
Hey baby, we can dance slowly
Love, on me, o-o-on me
Put your, put your, put your worries on me
Love, on me, o-o-on me
Hey baby, we can dance slowly
And I'm here for whenever you need
To put it all on me
Ooh, you're there for me when I
Need you to be, 'cause I
Find it hard to say the words
But some shit don't need an explanation, baby
I try to be strong, but I got demons
So can I lean on you?
I need a strong heart and a soft touch
And you're the one when I want love
It's you and only you that can be takin' away
The shit that I go through each and every day
Baby, I can't wait, in love with all your ways
Your arms are where I wanna remain
Grab my waist when I start to say, now
Hey, baby, we can dance slowly 
My, darlin', I'll be all you need, you need 
I know it hasn't been your day or week, or week, or week
So put it all on me
Oh, my darlin', put your worries on me
Can't judge you 'cause I feel the same thing
And I'm here for whenever you need, you need, you need
To put it all on me 
Love, on me, o-o-on me 
Hey baby, we can dance slowly 
Love, on me, o-o-on me
Put your, put your, put your worries on me
Love, on me, o-o-on me 
Hey, baby, we can dance slowly
And I'm here for whatever you need 
So put it all on me
I try to be strong, but I got demons
So can I lean on you?
I need a strong heart and a soft touch
And you're the one when I want love

>>>Remember the Name Ed Sheeran
<sos>
Yeah, I was born a misfit
Grew up 10 miles from the town of Ipswich
Wanted to make it big, I wished it to existence
I never was a sick kid, always dismissed quick
"Stick to singing, stop rappin' like it's Christmas"
And if you're talkin' money, then my conversation's shiftin'
My dreams are bigger than just bein' on the rich list
Might be insanity, but people call it "gifted"
My face is goin' numb from the shit this stuff is mixed with
Watch how the lyrics in the songs might get twisted
My wife wears red, but looks better without the lipstick
I'm a private guy and you know nothin' 'bout my business
And if I had my 15 minutes, I must have missed 'em
20 years old is when I came in the game
And now it's eight years on and you remember the name
And if you thought I was good, well, then I'm better today
But it's ironic how you people thought I'd never be great
I like my shows open-air, Tokyo to Delaware
Put your phones in the air if you wanna be rocked
You know I want way more than I already got
Give me a song with Eminem and 50 Cent in the club
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
I can still remember  tryna shop a deal 
From Taco Bell to TRL
I climbed the Billboard charts to the top until
As fate would have it , became an addict
Funny 'cause I had pop appeal
But they said time would tell  if I'd prevail 
And all I did was  put nine-inch nails 
In my eyelids now 
I'm seein' diamond sales like I'm in Zales 
Without a doubt, by any means
If rap was skinny jeans, I couldn't do anything in 'em
I'd be splitting seams of denim when I'm spitting schemes
Which really means, no "if," "ands," or "buts" are squeezin' in between
You sleep on me 'cause you're only fuckin' with me in your dreams
Not even when I'm on my deathbed
Man, I feel like Ed, it isn't time to drop the mic yet
So why would I quit?
The thought that I would stop when I'm dead
Just popped in my head
I said it, then forgot what I said
It isn't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ain't nobody cold as me, I dress so fresh, so clean
You can find me in my whip, rockin' my Fendi drip
Man, you know just what I mean
Shinin', wrist with the rocks on it, Buscemis with locks on it
Everything my voice on, this shit knock, don't it?
Balenciaga saga, I'm in Bergdorf ballin'
It's just another episode, my hoes, I spoil 'em
She like the fly shit and I like to buy shit
Shit, I'm gettin' stupid money, what else we gon' do with money?
Bitch, we be ballin' out, the king bring you 50 bottles
Tonight, we gon' blow a check, worry 'bout your shit tomorrow
The turn up be so real, we 'bout to be super lit
Boy, I'm kickin' straight facts, that's just how we do this shit
Tomorrow, we hangin' over 'til we start feelin' sober
Then it's time to start it over, here we go again
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
And it's about time you remember the name
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name

C'est pour mes frères et sœurs d'une autre mère
On a acquis le statut d'famille
Mon reuf a toujours couvert mes arrières
J'continuerai de mentir à sa petite amie
Ma mère peut l'engueuler comme si c'était son fils
S'il s'tape, je vais sauter d'office dans la mêlée 
Même si mes habits coûtent cher, c'est la même
Même si c'est lui qu'a cherché la merde
C'est vrai qu'il est pas réaliste, j'ai les boules de le voir
Décevoir ses rents-pa et perdre son temps
On est trente sur la liste, on déboule devant la boite
Y'en a un qui rentre pas ? Personne rentre !
J'suis le seul à te voir quand t'as pas les cheveux lissés
Notre équipe était massive au lycée, et tu le sais
Dans mon équipe, y'avait quasiment que des têtes cramées
J'étais celui qu'on envoyait pour paraître civilisés
Des urgences, des mariages, des naissances
Des procès, des nuits blanches et des micro-siestes
Tous mes amis en ont dans le ventre
Mais ça ne se voit pas comme un déni d'grossesse
C'est pour mes reufs, les vrais, pas les faux
Les frères, pas les potes, hey hey
Je te parle de mes reufs, les vrais, pas les faux
Les frères, pas les potes, hey hey
Je te parle de mes reufs, les vrais, pas les faux
Les frères, pas les potes, les traîtres, on les fuck
When you feel lonely
Know which way to go
I'll be calling you 
I'll be calling you 
They don't even know me but 
When you feel alone
I'll be calling you 
I'll be calling you
J'ai passé mon adolescence à voler secrètement
Si je te disais que je regrette, ce serait te mentir
Maintenant, je sais que tu peux te faire serrer demain
Et rien ne vaut le sentiment de vivre sereinement
La vie n'est qu'une escale, et ton corps n'est qu'un emprunt
Tu te plains, mais pense à la mort parce qu'elle est encore pire
Grosse galère, on escaladait les grilles des immeubles
Afin de s'caler dans les cages d'escalier pour dormir
On était ensemble pour la mettre à l'envers dans tous les endroits
Pour ves-qui la sécurité, faut du sang froid
Je sais le vide que ça laisse en toi
Sans ma plus fidèle amie, je serais sûrement sans toit
Calling you, calling you
When you feel lonely
Know which way to go
I'll be calling you 
I'll be calling you 
They don't even know me but
When you feel alone 
I'll be calling you 
I'll be calling you 
Avec mes pèlerins, on faisait qu'emmerder l'monde
Sur le chemin de l'amitié, j'ai fait de belles rencontres
Mais j'ai grandi, pas besoin de t'alerter, m'man
Quand on part dans nos délires, on a l'air tellement cons
J'étais petit quand mes Kabyles m'ont surnommé "Fennec"
À l'époque, on n'avait pas besoin de se téléphoner
Pour s’appeler, fallait siffler en-dessous des fenêtres
On s'donne tellement d'trucs, on est quittes
Langage cru quand on prend des cuites
Open bar, on le brûle en équipe
Open mic, on le brûle en équipe
Ma meilleure amie porte le voile, elle est mignonne
J'ouvre pas ma porte à n'importe qui, j'm'en bats les roubignoles
J'mets tous mes potos dans mes clips
Même ceux qui ont des têtes de guignols
On a appris à devenir des hommes
Ici, la vie te cogne à tour de bras
Je me dis qu'il faut qu'on veille les uns sur les autres
Pendant que mes amis dorment autour de moi
I'll be calling you
J'ai vu certains de mes reufs ne plus vouloir faire d'effort et s'taire
J'ai vu des vieilles branches partir, et j'ai vu des faux rester
Mon reuf a fui la réalité, j'aimerais l'aider
L'autre jour, j'l'ai surpris en train d'parler seul, il m'a vu et m'a souri comme si d'rien n'était
Y'avait personne pour aider ce frère issu de la jeunesse désœuvrée
Ta mère savait qu'tu la décevrais quand tu disais que t'allais te sevrer
Malgré des parents pieux, tu pars en vrille et t'as touché le fond
C'est plus la prière mais ta casquette qui t'fait des marques sur le front
T'as voulu t'enlever la vie, on aurait pu deviner
Avant d'sauter par la fenêtre, t'avais déjà le regard dans le vide

>>>River Ed Sheeran

I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
Truth and my lies right now are falling like the rain
So let the river run
He's comin' home with his neck scratched, to catch flack
Sweat jackets and dress slacks, mismatched
On his breath's Jack, he's a sex addict
And she just wants to exact revenge and get back
It's a chess match, she's on his back like a jet-pack
She's kept track of all his Internet chats
And guess who just happens to be movin' on to the next
Actually, just shit on my last chick and she has what my ex lacks
'Cause she loves danger, psychopath
And you don't fuck with no man's girl, even I know that
But she's devised some plan to stab him in the back
Knife in hand, says their relationship's hangin' by a strand
So she's been on the web lately
Says maybe she'll be my Gwen Stacy, to spite her man
And I know she's using me to try to play him, I don't care
Hi Suzanne, but I shoulda said "Bye Suzanne"
After the first night, but tonight I am
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run
A one-night stand turned a two-night stand
It was "come sunlight, scram," now we hug tight, and...
He found out, now she feels deserted and used
'Cause he left, so what? He did it first to her too
Now how am I supposed to tell this girl that we're through?
It's hard to find the words, I'm aloof, nervous, and Sue
Don't want this to hurt, but what you deserve is the truth
Don't take it personal, I just can't say this in person to you
So I revert to the studio, like hole-in-the-wall diners
Don't have to be reserved in a booth
I just feel like the person who I'm turning into's
Irreversible, I preyed on you like it's church at the pew
And now that I got you I don't want you
Took advantage in my thirst to pursue
Why do I do this dirt that I do?
Get on my soapbox and preach, my sermon and speech
Detergent and bleach is burnin' the wound
'Cause now with her in the womb
We can't bring her in this world, shoulda knew
To use protection 'fore I bit into your forbidden fruit
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one, I don't want to admit to something
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run
My name's , my name's 
River , river run
Call me , call me 
River , we'll let the river run
Always the bridesmaid, never "The bride, hey!"
Fuck can I say? If life was a highway
And deceit was an enclave, I'd be swerving in five lanes
Speeds at a high rate, like I'm slidin' on ice, maybe
That's why I may have came at you sideways
I can't keep my lies straight
But I made you terminate my baby
This love triangle left us in a wreck, tangled
What else can I say? It was fun for a while
Bet I really woulda loved your smile
Didn't really wanna abort, but fuck it
What's one more lie, to tell our unborn child?
I've been a liar, been a thief
Been a lover, been a cheat
All my sins need holy water, feel it washing over me
Well, little one 
I don't want to admit to something 
If all it's gonna cause is pain
The truth and my lies now are falling like the rain
So let the river run

>>>Runaway Ed Sheeran
<sos>
I've known it for a long time
Daddy wakes up to a drink at nine
I don't wanna know where he's been lying
I know what I wanna do
Wanna runaway, runaway with you
Gonna grab clothes, six in the morning, go
"How long you leaving?"
Well, Dad, just don't expect me back this evening
Oh, it could take a bit of time to heal this
It's been a long day, thumb on side of the roadway, but
I love him from my skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just run away and be on my own
I've never seen my dad cry
Cold as stone in the kitchen light
I'll tell you it's about time
But I was raised to keep quiet
This is what I'm gonna do
Gonna run away, gonna make that move
Gonna grab clothes and when it's morning, go
"How long you leaving?"
Well, Dad, just don't expect me back this evening
Oh, it could take a bit of time to heal this
It's been a long day, thumb on side of the roadway, but
I love him from my skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just run away and be on my own
Backpack and a flat cap turned to the back
As I packed my clothes up
My dad wasn't down with that plan to attack
Intends to show love
I don’t wanna live this way
Gonna take my things and go
If things change in a matter of days
I could be persuaded to hold on
Mama was the same
None of us are saints, I guess that God knows that
I don't wanna run away
And one of these days, I might just show that
Put my home in a suitcase
Tie both shoe laces, and hope that
Things change, but for now, I'll leave town
With a backpack on my shoulder
I love him from my skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There’s nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just run away and be on my own

Here we go, we are back
Trying to make history for charity
And may I introduce to you

Let’s have a party, it's Christmas Day
Your mum's cooking turkey but been moanin’ since yesterday
The presents are open and the bin bags are put away
Just until Boxing Day
Get to the kitchen for sausage rolls
Kids, drop your toys and dance along to rock and roll
Everyone's here, and now the dog's got thе trifle bowl
This is pure family goals
Let's sing, Mеrry Christmas 
The sausage rolls are on 
And our family are back, joined as one
Ooh, we're havin' so much fun
While we're here, can we all spare a thought for the kids who have none?
Sausage rolls for everyone
Wishin’ that Christmas was here to stay
The last one was lovely, so I’m glad that it's come again
It won’t be the same this year since loved ones have passed away
We miss them every day
Comin' together for something good
We're singing in PJs, but we’re helpin' the neighbourhood
We came back with sausage rolls just like you knew we would
And doesn't my mate look good?!
Oh yeah, Merry Christmas
I feel my hunger comes
Every time the oven turns on
Filled up with so much love
Every pound for this song goes to helpin' the people along
Sausage rolls for everyone 
It's Christmas time, sausage rolls and wine
We'll have a good night and a Merry Christmas
It's Christmas time, sausage rolls and wine
We'll have a good night and a Merry Christmas
It's Christmas time, sausage rolls and wine
We'll have a good night and a Merry Christmas
It's Christmas time, sausage rolls and wine
We'll have a good night and a Merry Christmas time
>>>Save Myself Ed Sheeran
<sos>
Build a fire and gather 'round the tree
Come and sing and dance to sausage rolls with me
Here we go, we are back
Trying to make history for charity
And may I introduce to you
Ed Sheeran and Sir Elton John
Let’s have a party, it's Christmas Day
Your mum's cooking turkey but been moanin’ since yesterday
The presents are open and the bin bags are put away
Just until Boxing Day
Get to the kitchen for sausage rolls
Kids, drop your toys and dance along to rock and roll
Everyone's here, and now the dog's got thе trifle bowl
This is pure family goals
Let's sing, Mеrry Christmas 
The sausage rolls are on 
And our family are back, joined as one
Ooh, we're havin' so much fun
While we're here, can we all spare a thought for the kids who have none?
Sausage rolls for everyone
Wishin’ that Christmas was here to stay
The last one was lovely, so I’m glad that it's come again
It won’t be the same this year since loved ones have passed away
We miss them every day
Comin' together for something good
We're singing in PJs, but we’re helpin' the neighbourhood
We came back with sausage rolls just like you knew we would
And doesn't my mate look good?!
Oh yeah, Merry Christmas
I feel my hunger comes
Every time the oven turns on
Filled up with so much love
Every pound for this song goes to helpin' the people along
Sausage rolls for everyone 
It's Christmas time, sausage rolls and wine
We'll have a good night and a Merry Christmas
It's Christmas time, sausage rolls and wine
We'll have a good night and a Merry Christmas
It's Christmas time, sausage rolls and wine
We'll have a good night and a Merry Christmas
It's Christmas time, sausage rolls and wine
We'll have a good night and a Merry Christmas time
I gave all my oxygen to people that could breathe
I gave away my money and now we don't even speak
I drove miles and miles, but would you do the same for me?
Offered off my shoulder just for you to cry upon
Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm
They gave me the heartache and, in return, I gave a song
It goes on and on
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me, they just left me on the shelf
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself
I gave you all my energy and I took away your pain
'Cause human beings are destined to radiate or drain
What line do we stand upon? 'Cause from here, it looks the same
And only scars remain
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me, they just left me on the shelf
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself
But if I don't, then I'll go back
To where I'm rescuing a stranger just because they needed saving just like that
Oh, I'm here again
Between the devil and the danger, but I guess it's just my nature
My dad was wrong 'cause I'm not like my mum
'Cause she'd just smile and I'm complaining in a song
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me, they just left me on the shelf
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself
And before I blame someone else, I've got to save myself
And before I love someone else, I've got to love myself
<eos>
>>>Shape of You Ed Sheeran
<sos>
A club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go 
Me and my friends at the table doin' shots
Drinkin' fast and then we talk slow 
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I'll give it a chance now 
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance and now I'm singin' like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, "Boy, let's not talk too much"
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is fallin' too
I'm in love with your body
And last night, you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
Well, I'm in love with your body
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Well, I'm in love with your body
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Well, I'm in love with your body
Oh, I, oh, I, oh, I, oh, I
Well, I'm in love with your body
Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
One week in, we let the story begin
We're goin' out on our first date 
You and me are thrifty, so go all-you-can-eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate 
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doin' okay 
And leave and get in a taxi, and kiss in the back seat
Tell the driver make the radio play and I'm singin' like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, "Boy, let's not talk too much"
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Well, come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead, mm
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is fallin' too
I'm in love with your body
And last night, you were in my room

Every day, discoverin' somethin' brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
Come on, be my baby, come on

Although my heart is fallin' too
I'm in love with your body
And last night, you were in my room

>>>Shivers Ed Sheeran
<sos>
I took an arrow to the heart
I never kissed a mouth that tastes like yours
Strawberries and then somethin' more
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Lipstick on my guitar
Fill up the engine, we can drive real far
Go dancin' underneath the stars
Ooh, yeah, I want it all
Mmm, you got me feelin' like
I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singin' like
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give mе the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til thе sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
And we'll say, "Ooh, I love it when you do it like that"
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
On the backseat in the moonlit dark
Wrap me up between your legs and arms
Ooh, I can't get enough
You know you could tear me apart
Put me back together and take my heart
I never thought that I could love this hard
Ooh, I can't get enough
Mmm, you got me feelin' like
I wanna be that guy, I wanna kiss your eyes
I wanna drink that smile, I wanna feel like I'm
Like my soul's on fire, I wanna stay up all day and all night
Yeah, you got me singin' like
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
And we'll say, "Ooh, I love it when you do it like that"
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back
Baby, you burn so hot, you make me shiver
With the fire you got, this thing we started
I don't want it to stop
You know you make me shiver-er-er
Baby, you burn so hot, you make me shiver
With the fire you got, this thing we started
I don't want it to stop
You know you make me shiver
Yeah, you got me singin' like
Ooh, I love it when you do it like that
And when you're close up, give me the shivers

And we'll say, "Ooh, I love it when you do it like that"
And when you're close up, give me the shivers
Oh, baby, you wanna dance 'til the sunlight cracks
And when they say the party's over, then we'll bring it right back, hey

Que a mí me gusta todo lo que exhibes
Yo puedo tocar los temas
Que miren cómo te recorro el cuerpo entero
Bebé, tú solo sigue
Tú eres sola pa' mí 
Yo quiero darte tu regalo antes de Navidad
Tu mentalidad e' mi debilidad
Llama a tu amiga pa' que hagamos una trinidad
Si tú ere' sólida, te pongo líquida
Esta noche, tú y yo sí nos vamo' a joder
Sí nos vamo' a joder, sí nos vamo' a joder
Yo estoy puesto, dime si estás puеsta pa' beber
Si estás puеsta pa' beber, si estás puesta pa' beber
Mami, si me sigues, nos vamos pa'l hotel
Tú ere' la primera, pa' ti no hay un top ten
And I'm rolling with a couple of people I know well
Know I can keep a secret, you know that I won't tell
Tu blanquito pelirrojo, rojo
Los que te tiran son flojos, flojos
Hace rato tengo antojo de ti
Ten cuidado de mí si te cojo, cojo
Que a mí me gusta todo lo que exhibes
Yo puedo tocar los temas
Que miren cómo te recorro el cuerpo entero
Baby, tú solo sigue
Tú eres sola pa' mí
Dime, Tainy, si están puestas pa'l perreo
Pa'l guayeteo, pa'l sobeteo
En la disco sabe' la rompemo' feo
Y si te veo, te bellaqueo
Tú no te imaginas lo que tengo pa' ti
Después de dos tragos, nos ponemos fácil
And we'll grab a couple bottles and fill up a glass each
You keep dancin' to the rhythm, this beat's to your heartbeat
Tu blanquito pelirrojo, rojo
Los que te tiran son flojos, flojos
Hace rato tengo antojo de ti
Ten cuidado de mí si te cojo, cojo
Que a mí me gusta todo lo que exhibes
Yo puedo tocar los temas
Que miren cómo te recorro el cuerpo entero
Baby, tú solo sigue

>>>Small Bump Ed Sheeran
<sos>
You're just a small bump unborn
In four months, you're brought to life
You might be left with my hair
But you'll have your mother's eyes
I'll hold your body in my hands, be as gentle as I can
But for now, you're a scan of my unmade plans
A small bump, in four months, you're brought to life
And I'll whisper quietly
I'll give you nothin' but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you
You are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you'll be all right
Ooh, you're just a small bump unknown, you'll grow into your skin
With a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin
Finger nails the size of a half grain of rice
And eyelids closed to be soon opened wide
A small bump, in four months, you'll open your eyes
And I'll hold you tightly
I'll tell you nothin' but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you
You are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you'll be all right
And you can lie with me
With your tiny feet
When you're half asleep
I'll leave you be
Right in front of me
For a couple weeks
So I can keep you safe
'Cause you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you'll be all right
'Cause you were just a small bump unborn
For four months then torn from life
Maybe you were needed up there
But we're still unaware as why

>>>South of the Border Ed Sheeran

She got the mmm, brown eyes, caramel thighs
Long hair, no wedding ring, hey
I saw you lookin' from across the way
And now I really wanna know your name
She got the mmm, white dress, but when she’s wearin' less
Man, you know that she drives me crazy
The mmm, brown eyes, beautiful smile
You know I love watching you do your thing
I love her hips, curves, lips say the words
"Te amo, mami, ah, te amo, mami"
I kiss her, this love is like a dream
So join me in this bed that I'm in
Push up on me and sweat, darling
So I’m gonna put my time in
I won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
He got that mmm, green eyes, givin' me signs
That he really wants to know my name, hey
I saw you lookin' from across the way
And suddenly, I'm glad I came, ay
Ven para acá, quiero bailar, toma mi mano
Quiero sentir tu cuerpo en mí, estás temblando
Mmm, green eyes, takin' your time
Now we know we'll never be the same
I love his lips 'cause he says the words
"Te amo, mami, ah, te amo, mami"
Don’t wake up, this love is like a dream
So join me in this bed that I’m in
Push up on me and sweat, darling
So I'm gonna put my time in 
And won’t stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me 
In a green field near Buenos Aires
Until the sun's rising
We won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
You never live 'til you risk your life 
You wanna shine, you gotta get more ice 
Am I your lover or I’m just your vice? 
A little crazy, but I'm just your type 
You want the lips and the curves, need the whips and the furs
And the diamonds I prefer, in my closet, his and hers, ayy
He want the lil' mamacita, margarita 
I think that Ed got a lil' jungle fever, ayy 
You are more than 
Something borin' 
Legs open, tongue out, Michael Jordan, uh 
Go explore in  somethin' foreign 
Bust it up, a rain forest, it be pourin', yeah
Kiss me like you need me, rub me like a genie
Pull up to my spot in Lamborghini
'Cause you gotta see me, never leave me 
You got a girl that could finally do it all
Drop a album, drop a baby, but I never drop the ball, uh
So join me in this bed  that I'm in 
Push up on me and sweat, darling 
So I'm gonna put my time in
I won't stop until the angels sing 
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Come south of the border, border 
Come south of the border with me
Come south of the border, border
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me

>>>Supermarket Flowers Ed Sheeran
<sos>
I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, "Don't you cry when you're down"
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink
Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down, you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"
I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face
And I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down, you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know
That when God took you back
He said, "Hallelujah, you're home"

>>>Take Me Back to London Ed Sheeran
<sos>
Jet plane headed up to the sky
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high
We ain't hit a rave in a while
So take me back to London 
I do deals, but I never get twanged 
Moves that ain't ever been planned 
No goons that were never in gangs 
Where I'm from, chat shit get banged 
Where I'm from, chat shit, let a 12 gauge rip
Yeah, it's sick how it fits in my hand 
I don't mix with the glitz and the glam 
All these stupid pricks on the 'Gram
I don't do online beef, or neeky grime beef
I'm way too G'd up to beef with grime neek
I bought an AP to help me time keep
My shooter ride deep, he moves when I speak
My shooter ride , he shoot a guy 
Leave you wet like you scuba dived
We were younger then and now we're unified
South London boys, get you crucified, I'm gone
Big Mike and Teddy are on grime
I wanna try new things, they just want me to sing
Because nobody thinks I write rhymes
And now I'm back in the bits with my guy
Give me a packet of crisps with my pint
I hit my friends up, go straight to the pub
'Cause I haven't been home in time, yes, I
But that's my fault 
Grossed half a billi' on the Divide Tour 
Yes, I ain't kidding, what would I lie for? 
But now I'm back on the track with Big Michael 
He said, "Teddy, never get off your high horse
And never let 'em take your crown"
I've been away for a while, traveled a million miles
But I'm heading back to London town right now
Jet plane headed up to the sky 
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high 
We ain't hit a rave in a while 
So take me back to London
Bass high, middle nights, ceilin' low 
Sweat brow drippin' down, when in Rome 
No town does it quite like my home
So take me back to London
Yo, when I squeeze off this little pen of mine
Done the remix, now I got Ed on grime
And this ain't like any top ten of mine
I arrived at Wembley ahead of time
And that's stadiums, man are aliens
I drink supermalts and Vibranium
I got an RM11 titanium
And I rock a 5970 daily, but
I want soul, I want flows
Don't need tags ripping off my clothes
Don't need pricks blowin' up my phone
And Ted said, "That's just the way things go"
It's just the way things go, amazin' flows
Grime or rap, man, I gave 'em both
Took this sound that was made in Bow
Went global, man, now the case is closed
2015 in a Badingham pub
I told Stormz two years, he'll be wrappin' it up
And you'll go through tears with the people you love
But when you get to the top, man, it's never enough
'Cause you can win BRITs 
And you can do Glasto 
But when you're miles away and you're feelin' alone
Gotta remember that there ain't no place like home
Jet plane headed up to the sky 
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high 
We ain't hit a rave in a while 
So take me back to London
Bass high, middle nights, ceilin' low 
Sweat brow drippin' down, when in Rome 
No town does it quite like my home 
So take me back to London
So take me back to London

>>>Tenerife Sea Ed Sheeran
<sos>
You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back
We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people who talk too much
You got the kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us
Should this be the last thing I see?
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need
I'm so in love
You look so beautiful in this light
Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife sea
And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Should this be the last thing I see?
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need
I'm so in love
Should this be the last thing I see?
I want you to know it's enough for me
'Cause all that you are is all that I'll ever need
I'm so in love
So in love, love, love, love
You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
And in a moment, I knew you best

>>>Thinking Out Loud Ed Sheeran
<sos>
When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darlin', I will be lovin' you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinkin' 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well, me, I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey, now, take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
And place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mmm
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul who could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinkin' 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Oh, I'll just keep on makin' the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
That, baby, now, take me into your lovin' arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are, oh-oh
So baby, now, take me into your lovin' arms
And kiss me under the light of a thousand stars, oh, darlin'
Place your head on my beatin' heart, I'm thinkin' out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh, maybe we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are

>>>Those Kinda Nights Ed Sheeran
<sos>
Damn, girl, with your sexy ass, haha
Let me holla at you
D.A. got that dope
It's one of those kinda nights
Yes, this beat’s takin' me back to my D12 days
When we hit the club to go and hell-raise
Probably end up baggin' the cocktail waitress
And takin’ her straight back to the Motel-8
Yeah, Bizarre's tryna get a lap dance
Off a Xanax and Jack Dan' 
Stripper walk by, I'm like "Goddamn"
She's like "That's harassment," I'm like "Yeah, and?" 
Holy Toledo, it's Miss Ohio
That’s the best ass I’ve seen in a while
We should be datin', she’s from Cleveland
But she's a bengal, this chick is catty
Is that a mini-skirt if it's a maxi?
That's the shortest thing for a dress since an addy 
She said "Fuck off" and threw her liquor at me
It’s one of those kinda nights
Then I said, I said
If you wanna go hard tonight
Well then, the smoke and the bottle are on me, ah
Slip into that red dress you like
When we arrive, we probably won't leave, ah
I love the way you move like that
When you push your body on mine, oh my
You wanna smoke, drink, dance until the sunrise
It's one of those kinda nights
This beat keeps takin' me back like my ex does
Only 'cause how good the sex was
Hit up the next club, met Alexa
But she was so extra, called her et cetera
Had her like, "Oh my God
My whole iPod's filled with your songs, I mow my lawn to 'em"
I said, "Oh my God, you know my songs?
That's totally awesome, I'm Marshall, what's goin' on? Ah 
Seriously though, jokes aside, how you doin'? You straight?"
She said, "No, I'm bi"
She said, "Are you drunk?," I said, "No, I'm high
I'm checkin' out the chick," she said, "So am I"
"What's in the cup, let me see that
Girl, where the rest of that promethazine at?"
She said, "Cool, gotta run out to my Cadillac though
And I'll be like Fat Joe, and bring the lean back"
If you wanna go hard tonight
Well then, the smoke and the bottle are on me, ah
Slip into that red dress you like
When we arrive, we probably won't leave, ah
I love the way you move like that
When you push your body on mine, oh my
You wanna smoke, drink, dance until the sunrise
It's one of those kinda—
Like the gas in the tank, she's gettin' low on me
Said she wants to go with me
I said, "Go with you where?" She said, "Out"
I said, "I'm a candle, I'll go out if you blow on me"
Walk her out to the parkin' lot, here comes Da Brigade
Turn like a flip page, Swifty look shitfaced
Say peace to McVay and me and this chick take off like a sick day
Drivin' around, I said, "Let's pull over," she said, "No problemo"
Windows are dark tint, roll up the car windows
Monte Carlo in park, bumpin' Bizarre's demo
Gettin' head in the bucket, Marshmello
Yeah, I never in the club met a woman worth knowin'
But if you're ho'in
Opposites attract, I'm someone, you're a no one
I'm high and you're bi, I'm comin', you're goin'
If you wanna go hard tonight
Well then, the smoke and the bottle are on me, ah
Slip into that red dress you like
When we arrive, we probably won't leave, ah
I love the way you move like that
When you push your body on mine, oh my
You wanna smoke, drink, dance until the sunrise
It's one of those kinda nights

>>>Tides Ed Sheeran
<sos>
I have grown up, I am a father now
Everything has changed, but I am still the same somehow
You know I've never been afraid of death
But now I wanna see the things that haven't happened yet
I still love getting out of my mind, I should cut it down
I still know people I don't like and I should cut them out
I feel embarrassed 'bout the things that I did in my youth
'Cause now, I have a child, I know one day that she'll go through it
Freight cargo, dot stops, and aeroplanes
Late-night calls, signal is in and out again
Feelin' low on serotonin and better days
Go, go, go, but every moment you're here with mе
Time stops to still
When you are in my arms, it always will
And lifе, life is changin' tides
I lost the confidence in who I was
Too busy tryna chase the high and get the numbers up
I have the same dream every night
A bullet through my brain the moment that I close my eyes
I still have to lean on a shoulder when I've broken down
And I have people that depend on me to sort them out
I sometimes fantasise I disappear without a trace
I've no regrets, but wish I did things in a different way
Low fly zone, lawsuits, and film stars
Headline wrote, "Princess and the face scar"
Broken bones, break-ins, and Babylon
Go, go, go, but every moment you're here with me
Time stops to still
When you are in my arms, it always will
And life, life is changin' tides
Time stops to still
When you are in my arms, it always will
And life, life is changin' tides

>>>Visiting Hours Ed Sheeran
<sos>
I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
So I could just show up and bring the news
That she's gettin' older and I wish that you'd met her
The things that she'll learn from me, I got them all from you
Can I just stay a while and we'll put all the world to rights?
The little ones will grow and I'll still drink your favourite wine
And soon, they're going to close, but I'll see you another day
So much has changed since you've been away
I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
So I could just swing by and ask your advice
What would you do in my situation?
I haven't a clue how I'd even raise them
What would you do? 'Cause you always do what's right
Can we just talk a while until my worries disappear?
I'd tell you that I'm scared of turnin' out a failure
You'd say, "Remember that the answer's in the love that we create"
So much has changed since you've been away
I wish that Heaven had visiting hours
And I would ask them if I could take you home
But I know what they'd say, that it's for the best
So I will live life the way you taught me
And make it on my own
And I will close the door, but I will open up my heart
And everyone I love will know exactly who you are
'Cause this is not goodbye, it is just 'til we meet again
So much has changed since you've been away
<eos>
>>>Watchtower Ed Sheeran
<sos>
"There must be some way out of here,"
Said the joker to the thief
There's too much confusion
Mmm I can't get no relief
This is Monday, drink more wine
Come man dig my earth
None will never lone the line
No one out of this earth
I see jokers on my left, thieves upon my right
You’d find me in the middle if I picked a different life
Before my name started tripling in size
But I’m still showing signs all attributed to mine
In the pitch black, it’s too cold
I’m all alone take me back to the roads
I had to roam to get here and I’ll hitch back
Get a cab to my mother’s house
See my old man and grab a six pack
Tell my brother I love him
And give him something that will see him through the hard times
What’s a brother for?
When I’m sick of this life I see
It has to be my family who lift me off the floor
Make sense of all the madness in a world full of money
Full of tears, full of war
I was a ploughman and worked from the earth up
Save your wine for the entrepreneurs
Well all along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants, too, yeah
Outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl 
Two riders were approaching
And the wind begins to howl 
Pour more blood in your cup
Take a sip full of sin and let your taste buds savour the buzz
The flavour of an ill-mannered nature
That lingers on as animals in all of us
Trying to fight for the right to live a life
But some will never win though
That’s why they live a lie
I don’t think I’ll ever win
All of this is anything
When I die I hope a brother’s at my side
There’s no trap door, or get out clause
The world can be your oyster or a set of jail doors
You’ve seen mine, I think it’s time I see yours
I bet you that we’ve been scarred by the same swords
So we are not so unalike
Apart from the fact I live my life in the light and now I’m trapped in it
The way I feel within a few years time
I might have a couple kids and just forget I ever wrote lyrics
Well all along the watchtower
Princes kept the view
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants, too, yeah
Outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind begins to howl
Take away the treasure of a man
Convinced that he holds heaven in his hands
Even though I ain’t religious I’m a little superstitious
Maybe there is a promised land
But will I make it or not is a different matter
I’ve been a joker, I’ve been a thief, I’ve been a rapper
I’ve been the only enemy that I can never beat
Give me a piece of mind upon a platinum platter
Well all along the watchtower
Princes kept the view 
While all the women came and went
Barefoot servants, too, yeah
Outside in the cold distance
A wildcat did growl
Two riders were approaching
And the wind began to howl

>>>What Do I Know? Ed Sheeran
<sos>
Ain't got a soapbox I can stand upon
But God gave me a stage, a guitar and a song
My daddy told me, "Son, don't you get involved in
Politics, religions, other peoples' quarrels"
I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know when I have children, they will know what it means
And I'll pass on the things my family's given to me
Just love and understandin', positivity
We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but Lord knows
Everybody's talkin' 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashin' and their portfolios
While I'll be sittin' here with a song that I wrote
Sayin' love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
The revolution's comin', it's a minute away
I saw people marchin' in the streets today
You know we are made up of love and hate
But both of them are balanced on a razor blade
I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know, I'm all for people followin' their dreams
Just re-remember life is more than fittin' in your jeans
It's love and understandin', positivity
We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but Lord knows
Everybody's talkin' 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashin' and their portfolios
While I'll be sittin' here with a song that I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
You know the future's in the hands of you and me
So let's all get together, we can all be free
Spread love and understandin', positivity
We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but Lord knows
Everybody's talkin' 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashin' and their portfolios
While I'll be sittin' here with a song that I wrote
Sayin' love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment

>>>You Need Me, I Don't Need You Ed Sheeran
<sos>
I don't want bruise your ears
Or hurt you again
But I got back-stabbed by a black cab
When I needed a friend
Now, I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That’s you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
And I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now 
See, I’m true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now, that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse, hell
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell
Call yourself a singer-writer, you're just bluffin'
Name's on the credits and you didn't write nothin'
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to BRIT School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smokin' on a crack pipe
And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear in Wikipedia
And musically, I'm demonstratin'
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer-writer like a Gabriella Cilmi
'Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
'Cause with the lyrics, I'll be aimin' it right
I won't stop 'til my name's in lights at stadium heights, with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now, I'm on Arabian Nights
Because I'm young, I know my brother's gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I'd gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter, yeah
The game's over but now, I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows, but
I haven't got a house, plus I live on a couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singin' them out
Wow, from day one, I've been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
So now, I'm back to the sofa givin' a dose of
What the future holds 'cause it's another day
Plus I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic
Gonna be breakin' into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Slipping into another rapper's shoes usin' new laces
I'm sellin' CDs from my rucksack aimin' for the papers
Sellin' CDs from my rucksack aimin' for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago, but more people hear me, though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doin' shows, if I'm not, I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growin' up, call me Rufio
Melody music maker, readin' all the papers
They say I'm up and comin' like I'm fucking in an elevator
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you

>>>Young Guns Ed Sheeran
<sos>
They call me young gun like I was a pistol in the primary
Speaking codes no binary
Irony, is that I don’t have a beautiful mind at all
I’m not tired at all
There’s no time to pause
Deep thought, with my feet sore from walking
Not a lot of money for a cheap Porsche
Though I don’t drive but I’m known by the guys
That are designed to make you go hype
Like Devlin & Grim with the chilling, chilling
Bring Yasmin for the singing, killing
And I’m keeping the melody where it better be
I’m deadly and readily burning within the evergreen of enemies
Higher than a feather with Amphetamines
Only my head top could be ahead of me
Voice hoarse but guess what? It’s never Ketamine
Making noise from Brent Cross
Head in the hedge tops
Giving up my soul again for the guest spot
Four young guns in London
When we’re coming up
And the feeling of thunder
Storming from my hunger
And I’m travelling higher
Should we wake up the fire?
That’s why they call me a young gun
And now my name is getting bigger
Press the music like a trigger
And now my field just looking brighter
Never stops cause I’ma fight
Yeah, me and Devlin young gunning
Skunk bunning, delete you with one button
If you don't know somebody best tell them
I turn everything here red, Ed Sheeran
I already went heaven, let's get them
I'll better them in 10 seconds
Since I got a holla back like Gwen Steffans
Follow that because I'm trend setting
 you get better instead of gettin' the message
I put in less of the effort
I'm still better than most
Come around try bread, all you'll be getting is toast
I've been ten out of ten from eleven years old
Try run from me but I left him alone
I'm back for the title like I'm living at home
See me at the O2, no gassing
Know that I'm coming up next like Yasmin
And the feeling of thunder
Storming from my hunger
And I’m travelling higher
Should we wake up the fire?
That’s why they call me a young gun
And now my name is getting bigger
Press the music like a trigger
And now my field just looking brighter
Never stops cause I’ma fight
I’m a young gun like a brand new weapon
I'm outstanding, he's standard and tell them what I reckon
To be a part of the arsenal present
You'd have to be better than Devlin, Yasmin, Griminal and Edders
So in that case forget it
If you don't make the cut like a radio edit
You'll get left beheaded then deaded
When Devs takes you out like a direct debit
One, I runaway for a minute of two
But now I'm back in the booth
I got ‘em all pissed like I poured Cognac on the tune
I ain't nobody's sun cause I stand on the moon
Young guns full of class A lines that'll heighten your mood 
Like chasin’ spirals with a spoon
You're not safe like a baby inside of the womb
Every time we arrive in the room
And the feeling of thunder
Storming from my hunger
And I’m travelling higher
Should we wake up the fire?
That’s why they call me a young gun
And now my name is getting bigger
Press the music like a trigger
And now my field just looking brighter
Never stops cause I’ma fight

Thought I almost died in my dream again 
Fightin' for my life, I couldn't breathe again
I'm fallin' in too deep 
Without you, I can't sleep 
'Cause my heart belongs to you
I'll risk it all for you
I want you next to me
This time, I'll never leave
I wanna share babies
Protection, we won't need
Your body next to me
Is just a memory
I'm fallin' in too deep, oh
Without you, I can't sleep
Talk to me, without you, I can't breathe
Girl, I felt so alone inside of this crowded room
Different girls on the floor, distractin' my thoughts of you
I turned into the man I used to be, to be
Put myself to sleep
Just so I can get closer to you inside my dreams
Didn't wanna wake up 'less you were beside me
I just wanted to call you and say, and say
Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
Never comin' down, uh
I was running away from facin' reality, uh
Wastin' all of my time out living my fantasies
Spendin' money to compensate, compensate
'Cause I want you, baby, uh
I be livin' in heaven when I'm inside of you
It was simply a blessing wakin' beside you
I'll never let you down again, again
Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go
This time, I won't break your heart, your heart, yeah
I know it's all my fault
Made you put down your guard
I know I made you fall
Then said you were wrong for me
I lied to you, I lied to you, I lied to you 
Can't hide the truth, I'd stay with her in spite of you
You did some things that you regret, still ride for you
'Cause this house is not a home
Where are you now when I need you most?
I gave it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
And I said, baby

I'll hold you down and not let you go

I'm falling only for the night
So I throw two thousand ones in the sky

And rewire all my thoughts?
Oh, baby, won't you remind me what I am
And break, break my little cold heart?
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh, oh

Take me down to your altitude

I don't know if I can sleep alone again 
Check my pulse for a second time 
I took too much, I don't wanna die
I don't know if I can be alone again

The wind in the sky
Please gather the clouds
And close the way of the wind
I need to make the beautiful dancer
Like a muse, so I can keep looking at her
Too bad if you forget about me
I have to live with it
We swear by God we will be together forever
Now I'm worried God will take your soul
Because you broke your promise
Like the fire which guards light up to search things
Burns up in the night
And fades into the daylight
Just as my love and thoughts of you
Burn in the night and fade into the sun
I know you want your money, girl
'Cause you do this every day, okay
The way you doubt your feelings
And look the other way
Well, it's something I relate to
Your gift of nonchalance
But nobody's ever made me fall in love
With this amount of touch, well
I'm not a fool
I just love that you're dead inside 
I'm not a fool, I'm just lifeless too
But you taught me how to feel
When nobody ever would
And you taught me how to love
When nobody ever could
Ooh girl, I know I should leave you
And learn to mistreat you
'Cause you belong to the world
And ooh girl, I wanna embrace you
But you belong to the world
You belong to the world
And I know that I'm saying too much
Even though I'd rather hold my tongue, yeah
And I'll pull you closer holding on to
Every moment 'til my time is done, yeah
And this ain't right, you've been the only one to make me smile
In so long, I've succumbed to what I've become, oh baby
I'm not a fool 
I just love that you're dead inside 
I'm not a fool,  I'm just lifeless too 
But you taught me how to feel 
When nobody ever would 
And you taught me how to love 
When nobody ever could 
Ooh girl, I know I should leave you 
And learn to mistreat you 
'Cause you belong to the world 
And ooh girl, I wanna embrace you 
Domesticate you 
But you belong to the world 
You belong to the world, you belong to the world
You belong to the loneliness of filling every need
Oh no, you belong to the world, you belong to the world
You belong to the temporary moments of a dream
Ooh girl, I know I should leave you
And learn to mistreat you
'Cause you belong to the world, ooh yeah
And ooh girl, I want to embrace you
But you belong to the world
You belong to the world
You belong to the world

>>>Call Out My Name The Weeknd
<sos>
We found each other
I helped you out of a broken place
You gave me comfort
But falling for you was my mistake
I put you on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me
So call out my name 
Call out my name when I kiss you so gently
I want you to stay 
I want you to stay even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait? 
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love?
Won't you call out my name? 
Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way and
I'll be on my—
I said I didn't feel nothing, baby, but I lied
I almost cut a piece of myself for your life
Guess I was just another pit stop
'Til you made up your mind
You just wasted my time
You were on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly, babe
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me
So call out my name 
So call out my name when I kiss you so gently 
I want you to stay 
I want you to stay even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait? 
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of loving?
Babe, call out my name

Unreal, what is this?
God done gave me strength
Are these the front row seats you wanted?
We'll have our final moment
I'm naturally black and
Like a waist that is snatchin'
Welcome to my world where it's packed in
At the top of the tavern
How I see when this happenin'
All the real have been dabbed in
All the, all the bumps and the grabbin'
Ain't no cops here harassin'
All the looks and the laughin'
And outside, it got traffic
'Cause inside, we wreak havoc
Yеah, I know when this
Yeah, I know when this drastic, whеre it's goin'
When I back up emotions
All this here, I'm controllin'
When I'm back in the
When I'm back in the streets, on my side, I'm patrollin'
When I'm back in the, when I'm back in the 
I know our love is forsaken 
But do you care if I was alive? 
Or do you wanna be famous? 
I took the top off
Like she took her lil' blouse off
Too hard to go drop off
You know that boy not soft
I never would travel
So I need me a time vault
I been up in Cabo
With my Bailey Osanto
In this world, look around, yo
It's just mano y mano
I might still eat McDonald's
But don't think I'm a Ronald
I went back to my land
Move like Moses, walkin' over seas
In my state because the country
Every part of it is part of me
Tell your parliament, "Pardon me" 
Off the saké, turned to Socrates 
Heavy moments on the ground
Feel it shapin' in the sound
'Cause we ri—, 'cause we right in yo' house
And you know that we down
If yo' ass don't know nothin'
Gotta know that it's time
I'm excited to jump in
So much that I'm flyin'
Put you right in the function
Took you right off a vine
Got this shit in a bind
We got it, we got it now 
Whenever I'm duckin' it 
I'm waiting on a let go
I know myself, I know exactly how to make you special
Go, collect your fame
I'm waiting in an echo
'Cause you keep callin' back, I thought I told you that we do not
Sorry, I didn't let you out

Like a nigga don't dance, but he make moves
They fuck around, now a nigga gotta shame you
I'm shameless, I be rockin' all my chains too
They told me, "Boy I think the money's startin' to change you"
Lord save you, Lord save you
'Member runnin' through the city in the same shoes
Now I'm gunnin' in the Benz and the Range too
I'm on point, know a nigga never take two
They said I couldn't reach Mars, so I turned to a star
Now I might have fucked around, might have raised up the bar
Now I'm talkin' cash, talk cash all in my palm
My nigga Cash said, "Watch what they do for the ones"
I know she wanna be poppin' all over the 'Gram
When the cameras come out, wanna hold my hand
Must be out of your mind, do you know who I am?
Man, you're killin' my vibe, do you know who I am?
They take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
Take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong
I might end up with your ho if I take one 
Now days if they don't have a story, they gon' make one 
Last night I gave my heart to a fake one 
I done end up on the blogs with the wrong one 
It's hard to tell the real stories from the fake ones 
'Cause now days if they don't got it they'll make one 
The only time I feel alive when I take 
I wanna vent but I know it ain't safe 
Must be out of your mind, do you know who I am? 
Used to hit it from behind, do you know who I am? 
I can't give you all my time, do you know who I am? 
Make you fall in love tonight, must don't know who I am, I am
I showed you a million, no videos 
I opened up Bentley doors, I invented doors 
Bodies droppin' and we duckin' the law
If you the one to take the blame, you can't say what you saw, no
They take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong 
Still comin' out strong
Take my kindness for weakness
Still comin' out strong 
Still comin' out strong 
Pluto don't dance, but I make moves 
We fucked around, now a nigga gotta shame you 
Shameless, I've been rockin' all my chains too 
Told me, "Boy I think the money startin' to change you"
Lord save you, Lord save you
They might pick you up, just throw you down with the fall
You must not know who I am
I pour champagne on the ground
My brother Casino said you wasn't Freebandz 
And at the time I couldn't see what he was sayin' 
You turned your back, I should have never gave you chances 
I call for loyalty, she didn't ever answer
I'm a boss, I'ma make my own family 
You're with my ex, while I'm with different color candies
I got Jenny, I got Tammy, I got Sandy
You try to sneak and leave 'em then I leave you stranded
Be honest to me

Still comin' out strong

If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you creepin', please don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know
I think about it when I hold you
When lookin' in your eyes, I can't believe
And I don't need to know the truth
Baby, keep it to yourself
I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you creepin', please don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know
Did he touch you better than me? 
Did he watch you fall asleep? 
Did you show him all those things, that you used to do to me?
If you're better off that way 
There ain't more that I can say 
Just go on and do your thing and don't come back to me
Woah, woah, woah, 21
Had me crushin', I was cuffin' like the precinct
How you go from housewife to a sneaky link?
Got you riding 'round in all type of Benzes and Rovers
Girl, you used to ride in the rinky dink
I'm the one put you in Eliantte 
Fashion Nova model, I put you on the runway 
You was rockin' Coach bags, got you Chane'-ne'
Side bitch in Frisco, I call her my Bay-bae 
I got a girl but I still feel alone 
If you playin' me that mean my home ain't home 
Havin' nightmares of goin' through your phone 
Can't even record, you got me out my zone
I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you creepin', please don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know
If you're playin' me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you creepin', please don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know
If you creepin', just don't let me find out 
Get a hotel, never bring 'em to the house 
If you're better off that way
Baby, all that I can say
If you're gonna do your thing, then don't come back to me

There's a room full of niggas
What you following me for?
This ain't no fuckin' sing-along
So, girl, what you singin' for?
It's 'cause we blowing like a C4
Got my whole crew blowin' like a C4
Twenty, keep the bar rollin'
Fake IDs in the trash, we goin'
Straight to the top, rooftop glows
With a handful of girls and they all so foreign
Brain so poisoned, rainbows flowin'
Light-skinned chick, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta friends, first flight from Poland
A whole lotta cash comin' straight from Poland
Why? 'Cause they loving the crew
They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
They loving the crew, woah
Smokin' weed under star projectors
I guess we'll never know where Harvard gets us
But seein' my family have it all
Took the place of that desire for diplomas on the wall
And really, I think I like who I'm becoming
There's times where I might do it just to do it like it's nothing
There's times where I might blow like 50K on a vacation
For all my soldiers, just to see the looks on all they faces
All it took was patience
I got a lotta friends to come up off the strip for me
The same ones that'll come up off the hip for me
The realest niggas say, "Your lyrics do shit for me"
I told my story and made history
Tell them I'ma need reservations for twenty
I've never really been one for the preservation of money, nah
I'd much rather spend it all while I'm breathin'
That OVO and that XO is everything you believe in, I know
They loving the crew
Oh, they loving the crew
Loving the crew, oh
Oh, they loving the crew
They loving the crew
'Cause we blowin' like a C4
Got my whole crew blowin' like a C4

Virginia Black got me tipsy
I'm in L.A. like I'm Nipsey
Spanish girls wanna kiss me
A nigga wanna come and diss me
And put a hex like a gypsy
They kill themselves, no wrist bleed
Got suicides on my SV
She do it all for the Fendi
She do it all for the Gucci 
Baby girl wanna choose me
She wanna use and abuse me 
I know she wanna text me 
I know she wanna sex me
Fifty thou' make her neck freeze
Fuck her once like, "Next, please"
My nigga, who would've thought? 
My nigga, who would've thought now?
I'll be right back at the top now
I got your girl on my finger
Blowin' my phone like she's single
Blowin' my phone like I'm Cee-Lo 
Somebody needs to come get her
Like, "Woo," with the curve 
I know you don't deserve it, know you don't deserve it
I got that work
I know you want the Birkin, baby, are you worth it?
With the curve 
I know you don't deserve it, know you don't deserve it
I got that work 
I need to know for certain 
Tell me, are you worth it?
Say I, a star was born last night
Way you showed out on that dick, girl, you performed last night
That's why you deserve that first-class flight
Buh-bye, 'cause I just quenched your thirst last night
Somebody tell the prince that the kingpin has arrived
If I lived over here, I'd probably have one hundred wives 
Walkin' in the club and they like, "Gucci just arrived" 
I ordered up a dub and then I threw it in the sky
I told her I'm a'ight, now she look like she surprised 
She look like a model, but a devil in disguise
Bum, bum-bum-bum, I feel like Rocky in his prime 
You know you came to fuck, so why the fuck we wastin' time?
I got the kind of wood that make a woman lose her mind
I'm young, rich and handsome, baby, I'm one of a kind
Just keep it real with me, baby, it won't cost you a dime
I know you got expensive taste and I don't even mind
Like, "Woo," with the curve 
I know you don't deserve it, know you don't deserve it 
I got that work 
I know you want the Birkin, baby, are you worth it?
With the curve 
I know you don't deserve it, know you don't deserve it

>>>Die for It The Weeknd

La vie n’est pas toujours facile
Elle est faite de hauts et de bas
I was told that it was Heaven
I was told that it was there before
I was told that you would never leave, ooh
And I was told that it was said before
If this is what it is then I'll die for it 
I'll die for it
I remember sleepin' on floors and missin' tours, I was rock bottom
Money on my head, that was top dollar
Had to stockpile gunpowder for the Rottweilers 
I was home with pops when the cops got him 
Voices in my head, tryna kill the noise
They killed Nip, we'll never fill the void
I know the devil cried a tear of joy
Look, I know the devil cried a tear of joy 
I never tell but you heard the stories
I can never tell, is this Heaven, Hell or Purgatory? 
Early mornin' ain't early for me, I'm losin' sleep
Whole lotta sheep, I'ma count them each but fuck it, I been up late
I been gettin' twisted, I been mixin' up the love-hate
Swear this shit is glitchin', I been missin' for a month straight
Lost faith but I'ma die for it
I'ma win, I just hope that I'm alive for it 
If this is what it is then I'll die for it
If this is what it is then I'll die for it 
I'll die for it
How much money will it cost us?
Feds, bounty hunters at the office, lookin' for some of our artists
We just tryna help 'em out, so they can change the outcome
Instead of puttin' pain in the street, they makin' albums
Changin' they surroundin', hopefully housin'
Smokin', we lounging in Boca Raton
Not a cloud in the sky, ocean from Mars shit
You can die a legend in your own right
Or die a street legend if it's on sight
I get so lost in my thoughts, powerful
Things I would die for, everything I built for twenty years
Won't allow you to make that crumble
Put you in the ground, I would catch a case for Jungle
And lean through the window, extendo, to clean you up
Rest in peace to Kiing Shooter
A foundation as such kids could stand
For respect, for my name, for the fam
If this is what it is then I'll die for it
If this is what it is then I'll die for it 
If this is what it is then I'll die for it
I'll die for it, said I'll die for it
I'll die for it, said I'll die for it 
If this is what it is then I'll die for it

To go back to my old ways, don't you cry for me
Thought I'd be a better man, but I lied to me and to you
I take half a Xan' and I still stay awake
All my demons wanna pull me to my grave
I choose Vegas if they offer Heaven's gate
I tried to love, but you know I'd never stay
But if I OD, I want you to OD right beside me
I want you to follow right behind me
I want you to hold me while I'm smilin'
And if you know me
When I go missing, you know where to find me
Driving down the boulevard is blindin'
Always blinded by the desert lights and
I feel everything from my body to my soul
Girl, I feel everything
When I'm coming down is the most I feel alone
I lost my faith
I'm losing my religion every day
Time hasn't been kind to me, I pray
When I look inside the mirror and see someone I love
Oh, someone I love
I'm losing my religion every day
Time hasn't been kind to me, I pray
When I look inside the mirror and see someone I love
Oh, someone I love
I ended up in the back of a flashing car
With the city shining on my face
The lights are blinding me again
I ended up in the back of a flashing car
With the city shining on my face

So obsessed with the camera lights 
You love her, but you can't deny

And it haunts her constantly
It's a false alarm to me

She chase hearts with the Hennessy 
You love her, but you'll never be 
She loves everybody 
Can't you tell by the signs?

Lo que pasó a ti te lo cuento
No creas que no dolió
O que me lo invento
Así es que se dio
Yo tenía mi bebé
Era algo bien especial
Con algo que a él le hacía mal
Miles de cancione' en mi mente
Y él me lo notaba
Y él tanta’ vece' que me lo decía
Y yo como si nada
Es mala amante la fama, no va a quererte de verdad
Es demasia'o traicionera, y como ella viene, se te va
Sabe’ que será celosa, yo nunca le confiaré
Si quiere' duerme con ella, pero nunca la vayas a casar
Lo que pasó me ha dejado en vela
Ya no puedo ni pensar
La sangre le hierve
Puñalaítas da su ambición
En el pecho afilada, es lo peor
Es mala amante la fama y no va a quererme de verdad
Es demasia'o traicionera, y como ella viene, se me va
Yo sé que será celosa, yo nunca le confiaré
Si quiero duermo con ella, pero nunca me la voy a casar
De que esta obsesión se me fuera
Se me fuera, ya desaparezca
Yo aún no he aprendío' la manera
No hay manera que desaparezca
Es mala amante la fama, no va a quererte de verdad
Es demasia'o traicionera, y como ella viene, se te va
Yo sé que será celosa, yo nunca le confiaré
Si quiero duermo con ella, pero nunca me la voy a casar

Give up the women
Before I lose half of what I own
Pour out my feelings
Revealing the layers to my soul

Can't let them get to me
And even though I always fuck my life up
Only I can mention me
See, before I let you go
One last thing I need to let you know
You ain't never seen nothing crazier than
This nigga when he off his Lexapro
Remember that last time in Mexico?
Remember that last time, the episode?
Asking me why the hell I text in code?
Four times just to say, "Don't text me, ho"
Told you four times, "Don't test me, ho"
And we finna lose all self-control
But you ain't finna be raising your voice at me
Especially when we in the Giuseppe store
But I'ma have the last laugh in the end
'Cause I'm from a tribe called "Check-a-ho"
Yeah, I'ma have to laugh in the end

When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe
Yene fikir, fikir, fikir, fikir

Been on another level since you came, no more pain
You look into my eyes, you can't recognize my face
You're in my world now, you can stay, you can stay
But you belong to me, ooh, you belong to me
If it hurts to breathe, open a window 
Oh, your mind wants to leave , but you can't go
Oh, this is a happy house 
We're happy here 
In a happy house
Oh this is fun, fun, fun, fun

Nights pass so much quicker than the days did
Same clothes, you ain't ready for your day shift
This place will burn you up

And they working in the trap, so get naughty if you want
So don't blame it on me that you didn't call your home

Two puffs for the lady who be down for that
Bring your own stash of the greatest, trade it
Roll a dub, burn a dub, cough a dub, taste it
Then watch us chase it
With a handful of pills, no chasers
Jaw clenching on some super-sized papers
And she bad and her head bad
Escaping, her van is a Wonderland
And it's half-past six
Read skies 'cause time don't exist
But when the stars shine back to the crib
Superstar lines back at the crib
And we can test out the tables
We got some brand new tables
All glass and it's four feet wide
But it's a must to get us ten feet high
She give me sex in a handbag
I get her wetter than a wet nap
And no closed doors
So I listen to her moans echo
"I heard he do drugs now"
You heard wrong, I been on it for a minute
We just never act a fool, that's just how we fuckin' live it
And when we act a fool, it's probably 'cause we mixed it
Yeah, I'm always on that okey dokey
Them white boys know the deal, ain't no fuckin' phony
Big O know the deal, he the one who showed me
Watch me ride this fucking beat like he fuckin' told me
"Is that your girl, what's her fucking story?"
"She kinda bad but she ride it like a fucking pony"
I cut down on her man, be her fuckin' story
Yeah, I'm talking 'bout you, man, get to know me
Ain't no offense, though, I promise you
If you a real man, dude, you gon' decide the truth
But I'm a nice dude with some nice dreams
And we could turn this to a nightmare: Elm Street

>>>How Do I Make You Love Me? The Weeknd
<sos>
We're goin' back in time
I'd like to see you try
Unpackin' thoughts through tunnels in your mind
I'll fix you mushroom tea
And cross the restless sea
Release yourself to escape reality
It doesn't faze you
I need a breakthrough
I only want what's right in front of me
Beggin' for it desperately
How do I make you love me?
How do I make you fall for me?
How do I make you want me
And make it last eternally?
How do I make you love me? 
How do I make you fall for me?
How do I make you want me 
And make it last eternally?
I can see the real you, girl
You don't have to hide
Forget 'bout what your daddy said
I'll teach you how to shine
And all the things you tolerated
Made you cold inside
But I can light you up again
Like embers of a fire
It doesn't faze you
I need a breakthrough
I only want what's right in front of me
Beggin' for it desperately
How do I make you love me? 
How do I make you fall for me? 
How do I make you want me
And make it last eternally?
How do I make you love me? 
How do I make you fall for me?
How do I make you want me 
And make it last eternally?

>>>Hurricane The Weeknd
<sos>
See this in 3D, all lights out for me
All lights out for me, lightning strikes the beach
Eighty degrees, warm it up for me
Finally free, found the God in me
And I want you to see, I can walk on water
Thousand miles from shore, I can float on the water
Father, hold me close, don't let me drown
I know You won't
Yeah, walkin' on the bridge, I threw my sins over the deep end
Sippin' 'til my stomach hurt, this month I done lost three friends
Early mornin', brainstormin', normally I can't sleep in
Sometimes I just wanna restart it, but it all depends
If I'ma be that same young, hungry **** from West End
Wrote my hardest wrongs and the crazy part, I ain't have no pen
Maybach interior camе with sheepskin
Still remember whеn I just had three bands
Now I'm the one everyone call on 'cause I got deep pants
Bro told me the way to beat the game is on the defense and
Never fazed by names that they might call me, but they gon' respect it
And I feel like you better off tryin' to call, I might not get the message
And she just tried to run off with my heart, but I blocked off the exit, yeah
Oh-oh, I know You won't 
I know You won't , oh 
I know You won't, I know that You look over us 
So we silently sleep
Bring down the rain, yeah, oh
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, I was out for self
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, I was up for sale, but I couldn't tell
God made it rain, the devil made it hail
Dropped out of school, but I'm that one at Yale
Made the best tracks and still went off the rail
Had to go down, down, down, this the new town, town, town
This the new ten, ten, ten, I'm goin' in, in, in
Here I go on a new trip, here I go actin' too lit
Here I go actin' too rich, here I go with a new chick
And I know what the truth is, still playin' after two kids
It's a lot to digest when your life always movin'
Architectural Digest, but I needed home improvement
Sixty-million-dollar home, never went home to it
Genius gone clueless, it's a whole lot to risk
Alcohol anonymous, who's the busiest loser?
Heated by the rumors, read into it too much
Fiendin' for some true love, ask Kim, "What do you love?"
Hard to find what the truth is, but the truth was that the truth suck
Always seem to do stuff, but this time it was too much
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, everybody so judgemental
Everybody hurts, but I don't judge rentals
Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm, it was all so simple
I see you in 3D, the dawn is bright for me
No more dark for me, I know You're watchin' me
Eighty degrees, burnin' up the leaves
Finally, I'm free, finally, I'm free
As I go out to sea, I can walk on water
Won't you shine Your light? Demons talk on my shoulder
Father, hold me close, don't let me drown
I know You won't

So, baby, this the perfect time
I'm just tryna get you high 
And faded off this touch

Are blowin' through my ears
These words I need to hear from you
And I know this is a fling
But you're hidin' someone's ring
It hurts to think I'm sharin' you
Ooh, I heard you're married, girl
I knew that this was too good to be true
Ooh, I heard you're married, girl, oh, oh, oh
If you don't love him 
Then do yourself a favor and just leave him
Your number in my phone, I'm gon' delete it

'Cause I don't play, I don't play
Now I'm sure you have your issues and your reasons 
But why you even with him if you're cheatin'? 
And I thought you were someone that I could be with

Can't be your pilot
Can't be your private
Make me your obvious
If I ain't your husband, I can't be your hybrid
I heard you're married
I bet he treats you like Virgin Mary
You like it dirty and I'm Dirty Harry
I thought we were some love birds, canaries, word to Larry
But I can't fuck with you
You put my love on the line and then hang up on you
That's a long kiss goodbye, I gotta tongue kiss you
And when doves cry, we ain't got enough tissue
I'm still in love with you
Where the love at?
You walk down the aisle, I can make you run back
Like, fuck that, where the love at?
And tell hubby I'll kill him, no hub cap

Only time you see me's when I'm balling with my niggas
'Cause my life too private, my ride too private 
My flight too private, my shows so riot
My jaw so tired, I go all night in my city 'til the fall
Then it's time for me to fly her
I got a girl at home even though she ain't mine yet
And she gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it
Baby girl, you know what I like
Baby, you know just what I like
Baby, you know what I like, like, like, like, like
Don't be mad, let her get hers
She made her own luck, she don't give a fuck
She's tryna have fun, take a break from the love
Man, your girl so bad, let me get her
Your girl so bad, let me get her
I make my own luck, I make that pussy talk
On call till the fall, he can like it or not, nigga, back the fuck up
If you ain’t with me, motherfucker, you against me
If you ain’t complimentin' nigga, you offendin'
I've been out here last year wasting hella time
XO is the only time invested
Them Fall shows every year like a birthday
And I'ma do it every year in my birthplace
And I ain’t been this gone since Thursday
I never said that I’d be sober in the first place
And she gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it
Baby girl, you know what I like
Baby, you know just what I like
Baby, you know what I like, like, like, like, like
Baby girl, you know what I like
Baby, you know just what I like, mm
I just passed that "nigga fell off" stage
Just sold out the O2 at my own pace
I can say that I’m attached to nobody
I've been getting paper while these niggas tryna stop me
Shout my nigga Doc, that’s a mentor
Had some bad business, nothing personal
But now that word out that we back
On some young Quincy Jones, dark skin Michael Jackson
And these the motherfuckers that they packaged
Their new shit all be soundin' like my past shit
Bring your girl to my show, give her floor seats
Then she go downtown like she owe me
Mix it up, pour it up, take it down slow
This my sound, nigga, fuck your sound
Did it from the ground, ask around, bitch
When I touch down, I'ma shake shit up
Fuck your new man, I'ma break it up
He can come back when I go on the road
But that pussy mine for the next three months
’Cause the kid back, kid back, kid back
Cop ten whips for my niggas when we land
Queen Street nigga making money overseas
Had a few more debts, I'ma pay it all in cash
Shout out XO, shout out to the boy
Broke bread on tour, man, it’s all love now
Shout my nigga Stix, doing good in these streets
Bet he popping more bottles than us right now
Reason why they stressing, city never sunny
When the kid come through with more niggas than Apollo
But ain’t shit funny, can’t nobody stop me
All my hoes are trained, I make all of them swallow
All of them swallow, all of them swallow
All of them swallow, I make all of them swallow
All of them swallow, all of them swallow
All of them swallow, I make all of them swallow
All of them swallow, all of them swallow
All of them swallow, I make all of them swallow
All of, all of, all of them swallow
All of them swallow, I make all of them swallow
<eos>
>>>Kiss Land The Weeknd
<sos>
When I got on stage, she swore I was six feet tall
But when she put it in her mouth
She can't seem to reach my
Ballin' ain't an issue for me
I'll make a hundred stacks right back next week
Do it all again, I'm faded off the wrong thing, the wrong thing
And I'll admit, baby, I'm a little camera-shy
But exceptions can be made, baby, ‘cause you're too damn fly
For what it's worth, I hope you enjoy the show
'Cause if you're back here only takin' pictures
You gon' have to take your ass home
'Cause the only thing you're takin' is your clothes off
Go 'head, girl, strip it down, close your mouth
I just wanna hear your body talk
Oh girl, don’t hold back, let it out
Don’t hold back, let it out
You can meet me in the room where the kisses ain't free
You gotta pay with your body
Not really into kisses leading into nothing
I'm into shows every night, if you play your cards right
I might fuck around, bring your whole crew on tour
Fuck around, turn you to my West Coast girl
Until they book a show in NYC
Gotta fly back east where the city don't sleep
Woah, I'm tryna finish all this potion
Baby, take your time, tryna sip it 'til the mornin'
And if you're still up, I'm tryna fuck you in the mornin'
Said I'm two days strong
And never sleep until it's mornin', until the mornin'
'Cause the only thing you're takin' is your clothes off
Go 'head, girl, strip it down, close your mouth
I just wanna hear your body talk
Oh yeah, don’t hold back, let it out
Oh girl, don’t hold back, let it out
Don’t hold back, let it out
Oh yeah, don’t hold back
I got a brand new place, I think I've seen it twice all year
I can't remember how it looks inside
So you can picture how my life's been
I went from starin' at the same four walls for 21 years
To seein' the whole world in just 12 months
Been gone for so long I might have just found God
Well, probably not, if I keep my habits up
Probably not if I can't keep up with lovin'
And I can't stand talkin' to brand new girls
Only bitches down to fuck when you shower them with ones
Probably not if my niggas round them up
Probably not if we take 'em to my spot
Probably not if I tweak all day just to sleep at night
My doctor told me to stop
And he gave me somethin' to pop
And I mix it up with some Adderall's
And I wait to get to the top
And I mix it up with some alcohol and I pour it up in a shot
I don't care about you, why you worried 'bout me?
All I want is that smoke, give me all of that smoke
Last week was my rough week
I'm still drippin' down from my nose
And I don't know how to drive, I make my driver get high
But If he goes under that 110, believe my driver get fired
And I don't got any friends, I got XO in my bloodwork
And I'm posted up down in Florida, 
Ft. Lauderdale to that MIA
Cold drinks with Grand Marnier
To the break of dawn, Kahlua milk
White Russian when the sun hits
White Russians with tongue tricks
I like the feeling of tongue rings
She like the way my whole tongue flip
She grind hard for tuition
She grind hard 'til her teeth chip
I make her hide it with gold grills
I make her suck it with gold grills
In the back room of the VIP, she don't ever sleep…
This ain't nothing to relate to
Even if you tried, you tried, you tried
You tried, you tried, you tried
This ain't nothing to relate to
Even if you tried, you tried, you tried
You tried, you tried, you tried
You tried, you tried, you tried
<eos>
>>>Less than Zero The Weeknd

Remember I was your hero, yeah
I'd wear your heart like a symbol
I couldn't save you from my darkest truth of all
I'll always be less than zero
You tried your best with me, I know
I couldn't face you with my darkest truth of all
'Cause I can't get it out of my head
No, I can't shake this feeling that crawls in my bed
I try to hide it, but I know you know me
I try to fight it, but I'd rather be free
Can we meet in the middle?
'Cause you were just like me before
Now you'd rather leavе me
Than to watch me die in your arms, oh
But I can't gеt it out of my head
No, I can't shake this feeling that crawls in my bed
I try to hide it, but I know you know me
I try to fight it, but I'd rather be free
I can't get it out of my head
No, I can't shake this feeling that crawls in my bed
I try to hide it, but I know you know me

If I ain't the hottest in the city, that's a lie 
School, teach you how to read the lines 
In these streets, gotta read between the lines
Room, room full of ether clouds, you don't want no smoke
'Fore, before I choke, baby, I'ma choke 'em from their choker 
Only the red in my eyes see where you come from
We, we the gang, either you run with or run from
I, I'm the head, rockin' bet it's re-up in the sock

Baby girl, comin' home and you can't stay, oww
Ooh, he do it better, that's a lie

1 ContributorAbout Me LyricsThis is just a page where I will list some random information about me…
Romance is the air I breathe, for without it I surely would die!
So many people often wonder, what is the purpose of life, why are we here, what is the secret of the Universe etc. etc.
I know the answer to this. The answer is simple. The answer is Love.
The meaning and purpose of life is nothing more than love, for a life without love would be completely meaningless and would cease to have any purpose whatsoever!
Love is the only thing that truly drives me, I follow my Heart, always.
I am an Artist, Musician, Poet, Composer, Performer, Businessman, I am many things. I am very creative & artistic. I can be accurately described as being both a CEO & a Rockstar all at the same time, both of those perfectly existing in one person, Me. I am a very unique man. There is NOTHING typical, average, normal, or ordinary about me whatsoever!
I have a way of leaving lasting impressions on people the first time they meet me, they never forget me, and the more a person gets to know about me the more they realize that they have never, ever met another human being in this world like me!
I like to do abstract paintings on canvas with acrylic paints. Although it’s been a few years since I’ve had time to paint anything, I will eventually find the time to paint again in the future.
I love music. I have been playing guitar since I was 5 years old. I’ve written and recorded a lot of original songs. My favorite type of songs to write are love songs.
I’ve also written a book of love poetry.
I do wedding photography on the weekends as well as all other types of photography. And I also work another job Monday through Friday, and i also am currently working a lot of overtime.
I was born in Orlando, Florida on September 18, 1974.
I was then moved to Columbus, Georgia when I was about 2 years old by my great grandmother who took me to raise.
I lived in Columbus, Georgia until around the year 2000 when I was around 24 years old.
Then I sold my house there and I moved to Huntington, West Virginia and although I did not like Huntington, WV I lived there until I was about 35 years old.
And then I moved here to Austin, Texas on December 22nd, 2009.
I live in South Austin, right off William Cannon on Bluff Springs Rd.
South Austin, SoCo, Downtown, The Drag, and West Austin are my favorite parts of Austin.
I do not like North Austin or East Austin.
I know I live in SouthEast Austin, but I do not consider the spot I live to be the real East Austin, I just see where I live as South Austin.
To me, North Austin looks to much like any other city, boring, lacking the “Austin” vibe, the people up there remind me a little of Dallas people, and I do not like Dallas at all. And I do not like anything at all about anything near the Rundberg area up North.
And when I think of East Austin, I think of areas like around 12th & Chicon, that just looks like poverty striken, ghetto people crime infested neighborhoods, full of the trashy people that have long criminal records and lack any proper education. There’s nothing good I can say about East Austin, in fact I think East Austin is a disgrace the the great city of Austin and I wish we could eliminate that whole segment of the population from our beautiful city. Hopefully, that area will be filled with condos or something so that that “type” of people will be priced out of Austin and no longer be able to afford to live within our city limits here.
There’s very little crime in Austin, but when you do hear about crime, it’s usually up North near Rundberg or Airport Blvd, or it’s East Austin.
I know I read back in the 80′s there used to be a problem with gangs/crime in the Dove Springs area  here in South Austin, but I don’t live in Dove Springs, I am near it somewhat, but I am just a hop, skip and a jump to South Congress, and to me South Congress Avenue is one of the safest, most prestigious streets.roads in Austin. It leads all the way to Downtown where it turns into just Congress Ave, and then goes on behind the Capitol where it basically turns into The Drag or Guadalupe, which is very similar to the SoCo 78704 area, especially where they have all the shops and used to have the food trailers like Hey Cupcake.
THAT’S the part of Austin, that I love and consider to be the REAL Austin, those are the areas of Austin that I LOVE.
Mayfield Park is my absolute favorite place in Austin to go spend time! It’s in West/Central Austin on 3505 W. 35th Street. I think it’s the most beautiful place in America, like Heaven on Earth! I even wrote and recorded a love song about and dedicated to Mayfield Park! That’s how much I love it there! I love the Peacocks there the most! And the gardens, koi ponds, nature trails and palm trees, it’s amazing to be there!
And right by Mayfield Park is Mount Bonnel Drive which leads about 6 blocks or so up to the highest point of Austin, Mt Bonnel. I love going up the hundred or so steps there and enjoying that view! I love going to these two places in Austin as often as possible, and if you can’t tell I love to walk, and I do a lot of walking!
I also think Austin has the most beautiful Skyline in the country!
And I love the Congress Avenue Bridge!
I love to walk across it all the way downtown! I love to stand on it and watch the Sunset, or watch the Bats take flight at night!
I love to stand in that White Gazebo they have Downtown and look at the Colorado River.
I love to walk around the lake there as well.
I love to walk all up and down Congress Avenue and also up and down 6th Street. I love the energy of 6th Street. And I also love the Warehouse District downtown right before you get to 6th Street. The Red River area right past 6th Street is also nice to explore.
I also love the Capital, it is very beautiful to see Downtown.
I love to see a good live band from time to time, or go to a comedy club for some good standup comedy.
I love to see Art and to visit Museums.
I love to try new Restaurants and foods.
I love going to the Barton Creek Mall sometimes.
My favorite clubs are Friends on 6th Street, and the Continental Club on South Congress. Maggie Maes on 6th is also good. And the Elysium on Red River is good for something different sometimes.
I love watching movies at the Alamo Drafthouse Ritz on 6th and the dinner & Milkshakes are good too there.
I love the Italian restaurant on Congress called La Traviata, and also the Mexican restaurant Manuels beside it there. And I love Conan’s deep dish Pizza on Guadalupe/Drag.
As far as Politics goes, I believe that democrats & republicans are really just two sides of the same coin to give us the illusion of choice,
I do not believe we live in a truly free country anymore, and it hasn’t been free in a very, very long time.
I do not like Obama. And, I did not like Bush or his Father either. I did not like the Clintons or the Reagan administration either. There hasn’t been a president during my lifetime so far that I have liked.
I believe that 99% of Fox News and mainstream Media is nothing but Lies, Lies and more Lies.
I think that the majority of Americans, along with the rest of the world are brainwashed sheep that are asleep.
I believe that 911 was a Inside Job, designed to instill more fear in Americans in which the government can use as a escuse to take away more of our rights and freedoms and push more of their terrible agenda upon us.
There’s a man here in Austin, Texas by the name of Alex Jones who has a show on KLBJ radio, he’s been talking about things like this for about 20 years or longer. He has a website www.prisonplanet.com and he’s also released about 17 video documentaries on this subject and everything he says or writes is backed up by documented fact.
I believe in and support almost everything he says on his show & documentaries and puts on his website. Check out his website and you will have a good idea on what my politics are.
I basically believe in our Constitution, the way our fore fathers wrote it, before Bush & Obama began destroying all the freedoms it contained with the Patriot Acts etc.
The best documentaries to watch of Alex Jones are Terrorstorm, and also End Game. There’s another great documentary by someone else called Loose Change. You can watch those for free if you search for them on Google Video.
Other than those types of polital beliefs, there’s a few other things I believe in…
I do not support abortion unless it’s for the result of rape or incest.
I do not believe a woman should have the choice or freedom to kill her baby just because she was a slutty whore and dosen’t want to accept responsibility and raise the baby herself or give it to someone else who will.
I also do not support homosexuality. I think it’s disgusting, and morally wrong. I think it’s the trait of a defective human being.
I am old fashioned. I am conservative. I believe men should be men, and women should be women. God made Adam & Eve, not Adam & Steve.
Furthermore, I do not believe homosexuals should be allowed to teach in schools or hold any type of job in which they have any type of interactions with children in which they could leave a false impression that homosexuality is ok on their young minds.
Now with that said, go ahead and ask me how I feel about Gay marriage…
And I will tell you that I am ok with that, because you know what, I’m just one person, I can’t stop it from happening, so if it’s going to happen, it’s going to happen, and I am a Wedding Photographer, so just think if they allow Gays to legally marry, the income I make from Wedding Photography basically would double overnight wouldn’t it! hahaha!!!!
Now with that said, I am not a mean or hateful person. I am a very easy going, nice, peaceful guy. And I work with people sometimes that are Gay and never have any problems with them. We get a long fine.
I basically only concern myself with my own inner world near me, only stuff that has a direct impact on me and the little world around me.
I don’t go out of my way to recycle, I mean I don’t seperate my trash into different trash cans etc, plastic in one and this or that in the other like some people do. I don’t have time for that nonsense. The world will be here for as long as I live, and after I’m gone, whatever happens to this Earth is of no concern to me. I don’t have time for recycling. Let that be someone else’s job to sort out all of that stuff.
People now a days are always wanting everything to be green, like hybrid cars etc. Me, I am planning on getting a 1977 Corvette Stingray soon with a 350 V8 engine that will only get about 10 miles a gallon. How’s that for green??? hahaha!!!!
I don’t worry about killing trees when I waste paper either. And when I go out to eat dinner, I don’t care if I eat all of my food or not, it does not bother me to throw away whatever I am not hungry to eat.
Can you tell yet I’m not one of those Hippies that you see so much of here in Austin????
I love Jimi Hendrix, The Doors, Janis Joplin, Led Zeppelin, and I seen the Woodstock DVD and that all is cool. I’m creative & artistic and believe in Freedom.
But, I am not a lazy slacker like most hippies are. I believe everyone needs to work to support theirself, earn their own money and not live off the government or off handouts or charity.
I do NOT believe marijuana should ever be legalized!
I do believe it’s ok for doctors to give to Cancer patients etc, but I do not believe it should be easy to get a prescription for, basically unless you can prove you have Cancer or something then you should not be allowed to smoke it.
I am not a Racist person. In fact I tend to get along much better with Black guys than I do White guys.
However, I do not like Rap or Hip Hop music. I do not even consider that to be real music. And I do not like Black people that listen to that kind of music. I do not like Black people that have a criminal record or smoke pot or do any other type of drugs. I do not like Black people that live in the “projects” or live off welfare or food stamps. I do not like Black people that do not have a full time job. I do not like Black people that wear their pants halfway down to their knees. And I do not like Black people that don’t speak proper English and pronounce their words correctly. I do not like Black people that dress like thugs or gangstas. I do not like uneducated Black People. And if you are a Black person that lives in East Austin or up North Austin around the Rundberg area then chances are I probably don’t like you either! So there! haha!!!!!
I am NOT racist. I just do NOT like ignorant, useless, TRASH.
I also don’t like White people that do those same types of things!
And, I do not believe that Whites & Blacks should mix races sexually and have kids together.
I think it’s ok for Whites & Hispanics. But not Blacks.
I would NEVER, EVER, EVER date a woman if I found out she had EVER been sexually active with a Black man.
That would just be pure filth.
I do not like Homeless people, bums, drunks, or drug users either, or anyone that participates in any type of criminal activity.
I also do not like White country types or Redneck types or Trailer trash types.
I do not believe in fishing or hunting, I do not support the killing of animals.
I am not a Vegetarian, but I don’t eat much meat compared to most people, and one day I’d like to be totally vegetarian, It takes a lot of will power though.
I love living in the City.
I love the Sunny days and warm weather of Austin.
I do not like cold weather or snow. I do not like to be cold.
I do not like the rain.
I am not materialistic, but I do like for the things I have to be nice and to be of excellent quality. I strive to live as comfortable of a life as I possibly can.
I am currently working with a realtor to buy a house here in South Austin so that I can move out of this apartment.
I am also working towards starting a romantic Bed & Breakfast in South Austin in the future.
I am a entrepenuer and I am in the process of establishing multiple streams of income that all target the same clients in the Wedding industry.
I also believe in living on a balanced budget, and setting aside money for savings as well as investing a portion into stocks.
Sometimes I think people see me as a very arrogant & egotistical man, I can’t help it if I am more intelligent than most men, that’s their problem and their own insecurities they must deal with. I think I am a very nice guy, very well balanced, highly intelligent, a hard worker, very assertive in life, with a huge heart and a very romantic side.
Some of my favorite movies, in no particular order, are:
Of What Dreams May Come, City Of Angels, Leaving Las Vegas, Pulp Fiction, Taxi Driver, Goodfellas, Casino, Finding Nemo, Naploeon Dynomite, Rock Star, The Basketball Diaries, The Doors, Rocky, Rocky Balboa, Wall-E, The Goonies, Star Wars, Kill Bill, Romeo & Juliet , The Devils Rejects, E.T., Friday, and Sling Blade.

Chicken is my least favorite meat. Beef is my next least favorite, and after Beef Pork. My favorite meat is Salmon & Tuna, and sometimes Turkey. Those seem to be the most healthy meats, if you are going to eat meat, which I try to eat as little of it as I can. Sometimes I go a few days without any meat at all. When I order Pizza, I usually just get it with Veggies. Dark Chocolate is my favorite, especially the truffles made by Lindt.

I like all kinds of movies, thriller/suspense/horror/drama/comedy/romance/documentary.
I do not like to watch sports or reality shows.
I don’t watch much TV.

But my favorite TV Shows are:
South Park, Seinfeld, Breaking Bad, Dexter, The Sopranos, Beavis & Butthead, and the X-Files.
I love to celebrate Christmas.
I am a very giving person.
I like to make a woman happy, it makes me happy if I can make the woman in my life happy.
I do not know how to swim, no one ever taught me.
I was on the Judge Judy TV show one time.
I had the lyrics to my song “Soul Brother” printed in a book about Stevie Ray Vaughan called You Can’t Stop A Comet by Cutter Brandenberg who was Stevie’s road manager and lives in Temple.
I was also written about in Kelly Garni’s autobiography, he was the original bass guitar player in the old 70′s band Quiet Riot along with Randy Rhoads who went on to play for Ozzy Osbourne.
A musician based in Dallas that has been on tours with ZZ Top, wrote & recorded a song about me and put it on one of his CDs, the song is called “Romeo”.
I was the person that got unreleased film footage of Randy Rhoads from film director Peter Margolis and uploaded it all over the internet for the world to see for the first time ever even though I did not have Peter’s permission, it made me a instant hero in the Randy Rhoads community/fan base, and now Ozzy & Sharon Osbourne even know who I am, they even had a meeting regarding me at one time awile back.
When I was in WV I once wrote a song about a man that painted a bridge Pink and I made the headlines of the newspaper there for it.
Stevie Ray Vaughan’s brother Jimmie Vaughan once banned me from ever coming into Antones, he refused to play if I was in the audience, I don’t know if the ban is still in place because I always liked Nuno’s club better before it closed, but as you can see I can be quite a colorful & contraversial character at times obvisouly! Hahaha!!!

>>>Live For The Weeknd
<sos>
Getting sober for a day got me feeling too low 
They tryna make me slow down
Tryna tell me how to live, I'm about to lose control 
Well they can watch me fuck it up all in one night
I'm in my city in the summer, camo'd out, leather booted, kissing bitches in the club
They wanna threesome , then some 
Spend whatever come in, fuck an income
Me and my niggas we ain't never going broke
And you, have to, do it all
Just to know where it gets you
Living dreams we can never afford
Now, we sitting in the back, sayin'

This the shit you can't fake, dawg, this the shit you need God for
How long do you think it's gon' take for y'all to fall?
That's a serious question, 'cause I seriously question all of y'all
Been touring the world, man, I've done spent racks in all the malls
And they know my story, flaws and all
I still got plaques hanging wall to wall, dawg
She just offered a strip tease, but she don't look like Demi Moore
Hips all on 45, waist all on 24
And it's all love in the city, still scream, "XO!" when that Henny pour
But I'm that boy, not just any boy, what the fuck you think that I'm in it for?
Roll up in that thing, got hoes like Prince, but they know, I'm king
Chubbs might hold that thing, if he get caught, he'll be home by spring
Things I shouldn't share, I mean, for the sake of my career
I'm not tryna stunt, I'm just tellin' you the truth, I swear
This the shit that I live for with the people I'd die for
This the shit you can't fake, dawg, this the shit you need God for
This that shit we really gotta talk about in person
There's some shit I need to work on, but I know you see me working, nigga, Champagne
This the shit that I live for, this the shit that I live for
This the shit that I live for, with the people I'd die for
This the shit that I live for, this the shit that I live for
This the shit that I live for, with the people I'd die for

Taking pain pills on the plane, gettin' chartered

Roaches everywhere, like we forgot to take the trash out
Flood my cross with ice, gettin' money my religion

This the sixth time gettin' kicked out
I can't feel my face, I'm on Adderall, nauseous

>>>Might Not The Weeknd
<sos>
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Everybody 'round me sayin' I should relax, 'cause
I've been goin' hard 'til my eyes roll backward
All I wanna do is forget about my past, and
Smoke a little weed, really nothin' too drastic
Any time you see me in a picture and I'm smilin'
Probably 'cause I'm faded or I'm chillin' with the fans and
Not really the type to let a nigga talk back, but
I'mma let it slide 'cause my niggas too violent
Shout-out to the ones who spend money like a habit
Even if they had a million dollars, they'd be trappin'
Got a couple girls shootin' movies on the mattress
Then I hit the booth, make the motherfuckin' soundtrack
Then I play it back on that eighty-inch plasma
Then I get 'em faded off that super fantastic
Roll that grandmaster, smell it through the plastic
Nobody can handle me, I'm gone
When the shit's too strong, the night's too long
I took too much and I've gone too far
And I might not make it , I might not make it
This time I might not make it
I might not make it, I might not make it
This time I might not make it
I might not make it , I might not make it
This time I might not make it, I might not
Bitches know, told a ho, "It's different strokes for different folks"
Came up out the north, we was playin' with a different snow
Took my niggas from the 401 to Pacific Coast
We no longer put no fish scale on the fishing boat
Listen ho, I know all you bitches want is liquor, smoke 
I know all you bitches want is dick and dough 
Told her, "You don't gotta make it difficult"
Baby, sit calm, we don't need another episode
Hippy bitches sendin' me titty pictures
She told me no religion was the new religion 
She said she don't believe in God but her shoes is Christian 
I heard she servin' everybody like the soup kitchen
Gettin' hoes higher, gettin' hoes higher
She got work in the mornin', I'm gettin' hoes fired 
Why you the fuck you call it purp when you mix it pink?
You know I fuckin' mix the drinks when the shit's too strong
When the shit's too strong, the night's too long
I took too much and I've gone too far
And I might not make it , I might not make it
This time I might not make it
I might not make it, I might not make it
This time I might not make it
I might not make it , I might not make it
This time I might not make it, I might not
I might not make it, oh no I might not make it
I might not make it, oh no, I might not make it

>>>The Morning The Weeknd
<sos>
I'm fucking gone right now
From the morning to the evening
Complaints from the tenants
Got the walls kicking like they six months pregnant
Drinking Alizé with our cereal for breakfast
Girls calling cabs at dawn quarter to seven
Sky's getting cold, we're flying from the north
Rockin' with our city like a sold out show
House full of pros that specialize in the ho'in'
Make that money rain as they taking off they clothes
Cali is the mission
Visit every month like I'm split life living
Let the world listen
If a hater's caught slipping
Then my niggas stay tight
Got my back like Pippen
Yeah, we still tippin'
Codeine cups paint a picture so vivid
Fakes try to mimic
But behind closed doors they get poles so rigid
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work
Push it to the limit
Push it through the pain
I push it for the pleasure like a virgin to the game
A virgin to that money
A virgin to the fame
So this my only chance
And when I'm over only pray
That I flow from the bottom
Closer to the top
The higher that I climb
The harder I'ma drop
These pussy ass niggas tryna hold on to their credit
So I tell them use a debit
Watch they image start to lessen
I warn them like discretion
Why these niggas testing?
Shit that I got them on straight bar hopping
To the music of the ambiance
Zombies of the night 
Niggas ain't talking if they hyping to the crew
Get it in like pockets
When the moon coming
Only place to find bassheads and hot women
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work
She'll feel it in the morning
Ain't the kind of girl you'll be seeing in the morning
Too damn raw, ain't no nigga with her rollin'
Ain't no nigga that she holding
Man, her love is too damn foreign
Look at all that money
The money is the motive 
The money she be folding 
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work

>>>Moth to a Flame The Weeknd
<sos>
Like a moth to a flame
I'll pull you in, I pulled you back to
What you need initially
It's just one call away
And you'll leave him, you're loyal to me
But this time, I let you be
'Cause he seems like he's good for you
And he makes you feel like you should
And all your friends say he's the one
His love for you is true
But does he know you call me when he sleeps?
But does he know the pictures that you keep?
But does he know the reasons that you cry?
Or tell me, does he know where your heart lies?
Where it truly lies
You should be with him, I let you go from time
You should stay with him
'Cause he seems like he's good for you
And he makes you feel like you should
And all your friends say he's the one
His love for you is true 
But does he know you call me when he sleeps? 
But does he know the pictures that you keep? 
But does he know the reasons that you cry?
Or tell me, does he know where your heart lies?
Where it truly lies
Right here with me, babe
Where it truly lies
In my arms, babe
Where it truly lies
Where it truly lies

>>>Nocturnal The Weeknd
<sos>
Street lights, turn on one by one
My hope is, descending like the sun
Try to tell myself there's freedom in the loneliness 
Always restless, story of my life
Disconnected, body clock's not right
Try to tell myself that I'mma get some sleep tonight
Found myself where I started, this isn't where I want to be
The time that I find hardest, always comes eventually
My shadow doesn't show in the dark
The night time is inclined to my heart
The emptiness I felt from the start
Will follow me 'till I fall apart
Nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal
My demons are blocking out the light
And my mind is about to lose the fight
Why can't I find peace, when a caracal could sleep tonight? 
Your absence isn't something that I choose 
But the truth is you were never mine to lose 
Spending half my life just tryna get away from you 
Found myself where I started, this isn't where I want to be
The time that I find hardest, always comes eventually
My shadow doesn't show in the dark
The night time is inclined to my heart
The emptiness I felt from the start
Will follow me 'till I fall apart
Nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal
Nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal 
My shadow doesn't show in the dark
The night time is inclined to my heart
The emptiness I felt from the start
Will follow me 'till I fall apart
Nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal
Nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal, nocturnal

>>>Nothing Is Lost The Weeknd
<sos>
I thought I could protect you
From paying for my sins
And I been walking this earth
Long enough that death's a gift 
Been living this life so patient
Until I see you again, it's war we're facin'
I know that if I die, my only choice is still defending
No matter what they say
My love for you is greater than their powers
And their armies from above
You give me strength
I'm with you either way
If I die, if I stay
I'm with you either way
Nothing's lost, no more pain
Just give me strength
The scars and the wounds
I wear them proud like tattoos
Rеminds me that I lost you
Reminds me that I'll bе
Living this life so patient
Until I see you again, it's war we're facin'
I know that if I die, my only choice is still defending
No matter what they say
My love for you is greater than their powers
And their armies from above
You give me strength
I'm with you either way
If I die, if I stay
I'm with you either way
Nothing's lost, no more pain
Just give me strength

>>>Odd Look The Weeknd

Your hesitation speaks to me louder than million words per minute
I was born to this life you're living, in this game, oh yeah
Said nothing will ever be... ever be the same, when you're finished
I freed a couple of souls, just yesterday, ooh yeah
I had a good girl in my room, no tats on her skin
I put work all in her purse, she got guilt all in her grin
And I swear it be the same, every fuckin' where that I been
All you girls try to be saints, I’ll make you roll with a sinner, well
You can come to my hotel, you can bring me a friend
You can dress up like twins, I can teach you some French
Paper planes full of kush, a couple cups full of gin
Don't know what city I'm in, wake up and do it again
And if you know me well, I don't like to talk
But when I make a move, you know it's loud as fuck
And if you wanna scream, get loud as fuck baby
I can tell you've earned a bit of deconstruction
A little bit, a little bit, ooh yeah... ooh Lord
Your hesitation speaks to me louder than million words per minute
I was born to this life you're living, in this game, oh yeah
Said nothing will ever be... ever be the same, when you're finished
I freed a couple of souls, just yesterday, ooh yeah
Do you feel like you'll come back around?
Does it make you strong?
Do you feel like you can take the planet on? Oh girl
Did I seem to give you a little bit more love?
To your gloomy life, to your empty life
Little life, little lie, oh yea
Do you feel like you got your money's worth?
Cause if you did this round's on me
Just promise that you'll come back to me
Feed me, baby, feed me, baby
Your hesitation speaks to me louder than million words per minute
I was born to this life you're living, in this game, oh yeah
Said nothing will ever be... ever be the same, when you're finished
I freed a couple of souls, just yesterday, ooh yeah

Pagne poppin', champagne poppin'
Pounds of weed, Sour D
That medical for my allergies
In the hotel with your girl
For 'bout a week, shootin' shower scenes
She a bad chick like Bonnie Parker
Rollin' blunts in my flying saucer
Juicy J - the new Skywalker, I'll put your ho in a body auction
When I'm having fun, I'm still getting paid
Got a whole lot of mud in my Minute Maid
Stay riding through the city with my 12-gauge
Hating ass niggas, get it any day
Got a house on the hill cost a couple of mil'
Juicy J got bank like uncle Phil
Keep snow bunnies that like poppin' pills
Keep a double cup, I like crackin' seals
Y'all niggas shit, I'm still going strong
Bought the loud pack now I'm in my zone
Rolls Royce got me feeling like King Tut
Got my codeine cups, 'bout to drink up
If you're talkin' 'bout money, we can link up
Bad red boned bitch, body inked up!
Your girlfriend comin' home with me
And when she alone with me
She gonna suck dick and she don't spit
Or I'ma put that bitch back on the streets
I'm kickin' it with girls that be going bi
Cause their pussy is the best and they head fire
One of those, it's gon' be one of those nights
Weed blowin', champagne poppin'
Pagne poppin', champagne poppin'
Got that drink flowin', champagne poppin'
Pagne poppin', champagne poppin'
Hey, I'ma visit the sky today
Hey, I'ma dance on the clouds today
And make it rain, on everybody beneath us
Just cause they try, doesn't mean they can be us
No, nobody can be us
One of those, it's gon' be one of those nights
Weed blowin', champagne poppin'
Pagne poppin', champagne poppin'
Got that drink flowin', champagne poppin'
Pagne poppin', champagne poppin'
One of those, it's gon' be one of those nights
Weed blowin', champagne poppin'
Pagne poppin', champagne poppin'
Got that drink flowin', champagne poppin'
Pagne poppin', champagne poppin'

>>>One Right Now The Weeknd
<sos>
Said you love me, but I don't care
That I broke my hand on the same wall
That you told me that he fucked you on 
You think it's so easy fuckin' with my feelings
I got one comin' over and one right now 
I got one comin' over and one right now
Said you wanna have my babies
I fucked you so good, you should pay me
Don't call me "baby" when you did me so wrong
But I got over what you did already
Body for a body, I’m so petty
How many of your friends fit in my Rolls? 
Bought you a new face, you should call me "Dad," baby
Hermès, but you dropped the bag, baby
Truth is, maybe one's just not еnough
You say you love me, but I don't care
That I brokе my hand on the same wall
That you told me that he fucked you on 
You think it's so easy fuckin' with my feelings 
I got one comin' over and one right now 
One right now 
I got one comin' over and one right now 
I got one comin' over and one right now
You're a stain on my legacy
We can't be friends, can't be family 
You probably fuck all my enemies 
I can't let you be next to me
Oh, you belong to the world now
So just leave me alone now
We're not in touch no more
You say you love me, but I don't care 
That I broke my hand on the same wall
That you told me that he fucked you on 
You think it's so easy fuckin' with my feelings 
I got one comin' over and one right now
One right now 
I got one comin' over and one right now
I got one comin' over and one right now

>>>Out of Time The Weeknd
<sos>
The last few months, I've been workin' on me, baby
There's so much trauma in my life
I've been so cold to the ones who loved me, baby
I look back now and I realize
And I remember when I held you
You begged me with your drowning eyes to stay
And I regret I didn't tell you
Now I can't keep you from loving him
You made up your mind
Say I love you, girl, but I'm out of time
Say I'm there for you, but I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
Said I'm too late to make you mine, out of time 
If he mess up just a little
Baby, you know my line
If you don't trust him a little
Then come right back, girl, come right back
Give me one chance, just a little
Baby, I'll treat you right
And I'll love you like I shoulda loved you all the time
And I remember when I held you 
You begged me with your drowning eyes to stay 
And I regret I didn't tell you 
Now I can't keep you from loving him
You made up your mind 
Say I love you, girl, but I'm out of time
Say I'm there for you, but I'm out of time 
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time 
Said I'm too late to make you mine, out of time 
Ooh, singin', out of time
Said I had you to myself, but I'm out of time
Say that I'll care for you, but I'm out of time
But I'm too late to make you mine, out of time 
Don't you dare touch that dial
Because like the song says, you are out of time
You're almost there, but don't panic
There's still more music to come
Before you're completely engulfed in the blissful embrace of that little light you see in the distance
Soon you'll be healed, forgiven, and refreshed
Free from all trauma, pain, guilt, and shame
You may even forget your own name
But before you dwell in that house forever
Here's thirty minutes of easy listening to some slow tracks
On 
<eos>

But I see somethin' in you 
But I see somethin' in you 
How can I explain myself to you?
Questions keep lurking through my mind
Is it the lover for the time?
I've given my heart, my joy, my soul to you
If it is real, I sure can't see
Gotta start lookin' out for me
And in my, my heart won't take no more
I know it seems that I don't care
Sometimes my ways of love ain’t fair
I feel it's time for me to take a stand
See, you have given me no choice
I feel I must exercise my voice and say
This feeling, there's no drug that can compare
You're so cold, I can see your breath, I swear
They told me not to fall in love
Wondering where it all went wrong
You were my poison all along
At night, I lay awake in tears and pain 
Searching my heart for what went wrong 
Askin' myself "What's goin' on?"
Why cannot we seem to see things eye to eye? 
Sometimes I really feel the danger 
And now I'm sleeping with a stranger
To see all these years, we flushed 'em down the drain 
Is that a love that came for us?
Now, it's too late for both of us
No regrets of what we’ve lost and what we’ve shared
Maybe tomorrow we'll love again 
Or until then we'll stay as friends, oh , one day
This feeling, there's no drug that can compare
You're so cold, I can see your breath, I swear
They told me not to fall in love
Wondering where it all went wrong
You were my poison all along
Poison all long, ooh-yeah
Baby girl, poison all along
<eos>
>>>Power Is Power The Weeknd
<sos>
I was born of the ice and snow
With the winter wolves, in the dark, alone
The wildest night, I became the one
And you'll know you're mine when the silence comes
Heavy is the crown only for the weak
A knife in my heart couldn't slow me down
'Cause power is power, my fire never goes out
I rise from my scars, nothing hurts me now
'Cause power is power
Now watch me burn it down
I been down with the coldest war
And I know where I been 'cause I bled before, yeah
How do I know if I let you stay?
How do I know if we did it your way?
You wouldn't take my place
Put me away, I'd die lookin' up at your face
How do I ever know? Who can I trust?
Only love could kill me, God bless
A knife in my heart
Couldn't slow me down 
'Cause power is power 
My fire never goes out
I rise from my scars
Nothing hurts me now 
'Cause power is power 
Now watch me burn it down
Breathe, feel the air that I breathe 
Air that I, air that I breathe
Who's hotter? Been a monster with a crown
So swamped by high water, keep your head up, you might drown
In this world, it's way colder, by the day, we count it down
Been around, just been waitin' up, she gon' come around
I took a drag, bust it out the gate, my lil baby, slay
I wore a flag, put that on my face, ain't nobody safe
Lift the mask, they gon' have to see what they can't erase
I took a lot, so I took it back 
Danger's on my mind
Ain't no knife, dagger, bullet that can do it
'Fore you, yeah, you know, I go right straight through it, yeah
Heavy is the crown, but never for a queen 
A knife in my heart
It couldn't slow me down 
'Cause power is power 
My fire never goes out 
I rise from my scars 
Nothing hurts me now 
'Cause power is power 
Now watch me burn it down 
Now watch me burn it down
<eos>
>>>Pray for Me The Weeknd
<sos>
I'm always ready for a war again 
Go down that road again 
It's all the same 
I'm always ready to take a life again 
You know I'll ride again 
It's all the same 
Tell me who's gon' save me from myself
When this life is all I know
Tell me who's gon' save me from this hell
Without you, I'm all alone
Who gon' pray for me? 
Take my pain for me? 
Save my soul for me? 
'Cause I'm alone, you see 
If I'm gon' die for you 
If I'm gon' kill for you 
Then I'll spill this blood for you, hey
I fight the world, I fight you, I fight myself
I fight God, just tell me how many burdens left
I fight pain and hurricanes, today I wept
I'm tryna fight back tears, flood on my doorsteps
Life a livin' hell, puddles of blood in the streets
Shooters on top of the building, government aid ain't relief
Earthquake, the body dropped, the ground breaks
The poor run with smoke lungs and Scarface
Who need a hero? 
You need a hero, look in the mirror, there go your hero
Who on the front lines at ground zero? 
My heart don't skip a beat, even when hard times bumps the needle
Mass destruction and mass corruption, the souls of sufferin' men
Clutchin' on deaf ears again, rapture is comin'
It's all prophecy and if I gotta be
Sacrificed for the greater good then that's what it gotta be
Who gon' pray for me? 
Take my pain for me? 
Save my soul for me? 
'Cause I'm alone, you see 
If I'm gon' die for you 
If I'm gon' kill for you 
Then I'll spill this blood for you, hey
Who gon' pray for me? 
Take my pain for me? 
Save my soul for me? 
'Cause I'm alone, you see 
If I'm gon' die for you 
If I'm gon' kill for you 
Then I'll spill this blood for you, hey
Just in case my faith go, I'll live by my own law
I'll live by my own law, I'll live by my own
Just in case my faith go, I'll live by my own law
I'll live by my own law, I'll live by my own

>>>Price on My Head The Weeknd
<sos>
Yeah, I pull up to my town with a price on my head
I pull up to my town, I'm outside
They wanna see me drown, it’s on sight's what they said
I heard these niggas want to take my life
I don't apologize, I would die for this shit
I don’t apologize, I don't hide
I'm Kubrick with the shine, got the ice on my neck
They wanna throw a bag on him
Price on my head, got a price on my head
Night when I rest, with a knife by my bed
I'm so paranoid, I'ma sleep when I'm dead
I'm so paranoid, I'ma sleep when I’m dead
Price on my head, got a price on my head 
Night when I rest, with a knife by my bed 
I’m so paranoid, I'ma sleep when I’m dead 
I'm so paranoid, I'ma sleep when I’m dead
I cut off all my side hoes, in du Cap with a dime though
All these girls been ran through, on the low real snipe mode
I can't sleep, that's insomnia, so much ice like I'm Tonya
All my boys livin' debt free, your squad like Wesley
I want head on a jet ski, she gave me head for a Fendi
For a Prada, she got sexy, for a Lambo or a Bentley
My mansion is no joke, house party like 1 OAK
Weed louder than gun smoke, get high off one toke
You beefin' with yourself, tell the truth
Niggas on your side, they would ride for me too
Still wasting they time, tryna come for me too
I'm too busy, faded in Japan with the crew
With the crew, with the crew, with the crew
Shout out all the girls who've been riding for me too
Niggas want me dead, I've been dead, nothing new
Niggas want me dead, for a bag and a
Price on my head, got a price on my head 
Night when I rest, with a knife by my bed 
I'm so paranoid, I'ma sleep when I'm dead
They tried to get me and they missed, if we send shots then they gon' hit
I could get your top taken off for less than a quarter brick 
One of my rings could get him off, we'll check him off the list
My shooter a codeine addict, he'll do it for a pint of Actavis
Since I met Cash, got a lot of racks, I still want more 
I can tell by the way you carry yourself, you never sold no dope 
Growin' up, my mama beat my ass, then cleaned my mouth with soap 
Now she showin' up to work in a Balenciaga coat
Price on my head, got your life 'round my neck
Put a brown kid in the Southside Rex and me is what you'll get
My block was like the car wash, you drive in, you gon' get wet
Had take a lot of losses, made me comfortable with death 
Took too much Act', had to pop a Xan to reset
His bitch gave me some top, and now he wanna send me threats
Live my best life, I know my opps just wanna see me dead
Took his life, I paid him double what they put on my head
Price on my head, got a price on my head 
Night when I rest, with a knife by my bed 
I'm so paranoid, I'ma sleep when I'm dead 
I'm so paranoid, I'ma sleep when I'm dead
Price on my head, got a price on my head 
Night when I rest, with a knife by my bed 
I'm so paranoid, I'ma sleep when I'm dead
I'm so paranoid, I'ma sleep when I'm dead

>>>Prisoner The Weeknd
<sos>
You bring good to my lonely life, honestly 
It's hard for me to look into your eyes
When I say  that I would be nothing without your love 
I feel the rush and it's amazing
Maybe I've been always destined to end up in this place , yeah
I don't mean to come off selfish, but I want it all 
Love will always be a lesson, let's get out of its way 
'Cause I know , all I know , all I know 
I'm a prisoner to my addiction
I'm addicted to a life that's so empty and so cold
I'm a prisoner to my decisions
I think I've been in Hollywood for too long 
'Cause I can feel my soul burning, feel it burning slow
But I would be nothing without the touch 
I feel the rush and it's amazing, hmm
Maybe I've been always destined to end up in this place
I don't mean to come off selfish, but I want it all 
Love will always be a lesson, let's get out of its way 
'Cause I know , all I know , all I know 
I'm a prisoner to my addiction
I'm addicted to a life that's so empty and so cold
I'm a prisoner to my decisions
Woooo, woooo, woooo 
I'm a prisoner to my addiction
I'm addicted to a life that's so empty and so cold 
I'm a prisoner to my decisions
I get so wrapped up in a world where nothing's as it seems
And real life is stranger than my dreams

<sos>
She's about to earn some bragging rights
I'm 'bout to give it up like I've been holding back all night
Girl, take pride in what you want to do
Even if that means a new man every night inside of you
Baby, I don't mind
You can tell by how I roll
Cause my clique hot and my cup cold
My talk slurred cause I’m so throwed
And I'm wiping sweat from my last show
And he's TG and I'm XO
I'm only here for one night
Then I'ma be a memory
Say it in my ear, so I can hear what you say to me
I got cups full of that Rosé
Smoke anything that's passed to me
Don't worry 'bout my voice
I won't need it for what I'm about to do to you
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I might have to take your number when I'm through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I might have to take your number when I'm through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me
Light years past the class
Hit it, don't have to pass
Nigga, we the new Aftermath
Niggas after fame, I just had to laugh
Niggas after fame, I'm after cash
You's a fan, I'm a player
I'm the man, you's a hater
And I only smoke papers
That's how you tell I'm Taylor'd
Break it down, rolling weed on the island of my kitchen
And not a thing goes down without permission
Look, everything I got on I was made for
Everything that I got I done came for
All the shit that you see I done slaved for
All the cars and the crib, yeah that's paid for
Need I say more
Spend so much money on clothes
Said fuck a store, making my own
I hope that you're rolling one up while you're singing along
And know I was rolling one while I was making this song
Pour out some shots
You're taking too long
Young and I'm rich
And plus all of my friends on that Bombay and lemonade
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I might have to take your number when I'm through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I might have to take your number when I'm through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me
I'm on some gin, you on some gin
I'm moving slow, I'm driving fast
I hit the weed, you take the wheel
Drop the top in that 69
And that motor roar in that old Chevelle
Can’t say a thing, how you supposed to feel
Stacking all of this paper, dawg
I like to call this shit old news
And these haters jocking our old moves
Popping champagne cause we made it
Back of the Phantom, we faded
All of this shit that I did I probably won't remember tomorrow
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you
I might have to take your number when I'm through with you
All I ask of you is try to earn my memory
Make me remember you like you remember me
Bad bitch, girl I think I might get used to you

Can't tie me down

Save your tears for another

And now you won't love me for a second time

>>>Scared to Live The Weeknd
<sos>
When I saw the signs, I shoulda let you go 
But I kept you beside me
And if I held you back, at least I held you close 
Should have known you were lonely
I know things will never be the same
Time we lost will never be replaced
I'm the reason you forgot to love
So don't be scared to live again
Be scared to live again
No, don't be scared to live again
Be scared to live again
You always miss the chance to fall for someone else 
'Cause your heart only knows me
They try to win your love, but there was nothing left 
They just made you feel lonely 
I am not the man I used to be
Did some things I couldn't let you see
Refuse to be the one who taints your heart
So don't be scared to live again
Be scared to live again
No, don't be scared to live again
Be scared to live again 
I hope you know that, I hope you know that
I've been praying that you find yourself
I hope you know that, I hope you know that
We fell apart, right from the start
I should have made you my only
When it's said and done
So don't be scared to live again
Be scared to live again
I said don't be scared to live again

I hope you know that, I hope you know that
I've been praying that you find yourself
I hope you know that, I hope you know that

>>>Sidewalks The Weeknd
<sos>
Uh, uh, uh, uh-uh, uh, yeah, like
I ran out of tears when I was eighteen
So nobody made me but the main streets
'Cause too many people think they made me
Well, if they really made me, then replace me
Homeless to Forbes List, these niggas bring no stress
I feel like Moses, I feel like I'm chosen
And if you ain't my nigga, then your girl single to me
I don't give a damn if a nigga said he knew me
Grew up with no father so nobody ever "son" me
My flow too sick, Kevin Costner couldn't touch me
I know you wish that nobody ever love me
I feel useless when I'm never makin' money, ah
Well, this the life we always fantasized
Rich folk problem through a Queen Street nigga's eyes
Every time you see me pullin' up in Aventadors
Just know we been grindin' on them sidewalks
Sidewalks saved my life
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life
They show me all the signs
They don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they lead me on
I come from murder one, brung late night melee
We hung all summer, sprung mattress with bae bae
Trippin' off Dyke and my name strike with pay day
Flippin' blue lightnin', tightenin', strapped with AK
OG one, told me one, show me one, eight ways
Pussy, power, profit and headache
I reminisce my life innocence or life innocent
Or life intimate, with fame
Light limo tint with light women, dark women in it
Aw, Kenny, good game
She wanna hang with a Starboy
The sun and the moon and star, boy
I line 'em up, we grind 'em up, there's nine of us
And five of us have probably fucked
She mollied up, I tallied up all the parts, boy
Twenty legs, arms, head 
Head, head, more head 
Oh God, bless the dead 
I'm livin' life, high off life
I wear my chokes off to bed
I'm the greatest nigga, why you scared to say it?
I wanna rock, I wanna rock
I wanna cop more land, I never stop
I wanna quick advance on a bill if it ain't one
Break everything, I'm a hustler, came from
Sidewalks saved my life 
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life 
They show me all the signs
They don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they lead me on

A couple niggas with a suitcase
Suit and tie niggas who play roleplay
When it comes to money, she play no games
She lick it up just like a candy 
She wanna make 'em leave they family 
She tryna live a life so fancy 
She wanna pull up in a Bentley

Six feet under, she gon' kill me for that paper
Not the type to fuck around, go'n and turn that ass around
She don't depend on anybody
Know just what to do with her own body
Countin' all that money like a hobby
She don't give a fuck about nobody
And she got her whole crew poppin'
And she bend it over like she got no backbone
Got a couple niggas blingin' up a trap phone
She don't need nobody waitin' back home, she got it
She lick it up just like a candy 
She wanna make 'em leave they family 
She tryna live a life so fancy 
She wanna pull up in a Bentley

Devil on my shoulder tellin' me I'll die soon

Dependent on ya, gotta learn to be alone 
'Cause I'm so desensitized
When our skin is touching , I need drugs to love you 
You want so much more from me, but I can only fuck you 
I spent every day right beside you , 'side you 
A hundred pics of me on your phone
Now you're someone that I used to know
At this point, we playin' with fire , fire 
You don't wanna see what's in my phone
It's just gonna hurt you more 
I'd do anything in my power to see you just smile 
I want you to prosper and come proper

>>>Snowchild The Weeknd

I used to pray when I was sixteen
If I didn't make it, then I'd probably make my wrist bleed
Not to mislead, turn my nightmares into big dreams
Whole squad mobbin' even though we only six deep
I was singing notes while my niggas played with six keys
Walking in the snow before I ever made my wrist freeze
I was blowing smoke, had me dizzy like Gillespie
Niggas had no homes, we were living in the dead streets
You couldn't find me like I'm Hoffa
Cover girls jumping out the page like they pop ups
Spending all my money on these niggas that I brought up
Taking care of families for my brothers when they locked up
And I had nothing to believe in
Couldn't even breathe and
For that money I was fiending
Cali was the mission but now a nigga leaving
Leaving, leaving into the night
Now a nigga leaving, leaving
Leaving into the night, oh
She like my futuristic sounds in the new spaceship
Futuristic sex, give her Philip K dick
She never need a man, she what a man need
So I keep on falling for her daily
We was at Coachella going brazy
Stack a couple M's like I was Shady
Now I'm in Tribeca like I'm Jay-Z
Rockin' Sorayama like he pay me
I just signed a new deal with Mercedes
Got me movin' dirty like I'm Swayze
All my diamonds dancing like they Swayze
All my diamonds hitting like they Swae Lee
Jet so big got a business and a coach
Always livin' on the road, rockin' Louis à la mode, nigga
And for that money, I been fiending
Cali was the mission, but now a nigga leaving
Leaving, leaving into the night
Now a nigga leaving, leaving
Leaving into the night, oh
Twenty mill' mansion, never lived in it
Zero edge pool, never dipped in it
Superstar neighbor in my business
Paparazzi tryna catch me slippin' and
Going on tour is my vacation
Every month another accusation
Only thing I'm phobic of is failing
I was never blessed with any patience
So a nigga leaving, leaving, leaving into the night
Now a nigga leaving, leaving
Leaving into the night, oh

I gotta get myself together, it's a date
I spent two thousand on a sweater, way
I think the belts inside the store look better on my waist
I think my nuts look better on her face
This bitch got addicted, all she did was take a taste
Now you gettin' mad because you got replaced
The brown boy and the Starboy on a track
Haters gonna say "this shit is wack"
I went to the hills straight from the trap
I'ma fuck your bitch and give her back
She said she pop pills, I told her "Stop it"
Check my little pocket, I got options
I'm the first brown boy to get it poppin'
If I say the word, my shooters gonna pop 'em

She tried to take a selfie at my Grandma's funeral
Used to roam on Queen, now I sing Queen Street anthems
Used to hate attention, now I pull up in that wagon
And I was broken, I was broken, I was so broke
I used to roam around the town when I was homeless
Me and Lamar would rob a nigga for his Jordans
And flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix

Pussy on the house, everybody fuckin'
Man, I miss my city, man, it's been a minute 
MIA a habit, Cali was the mission
Cruise through the west-end in my new Benz 
I'm just tryna live life through a new lens
Drivin' by the streets I used to walk through
When I had no crib, I guess you call that shit a miracle
Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I get it on the low
Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill
Roll some, think I’ll roll some
To know some, if we both honest
Who lasts? Yeah, you lie
Spent the whole summer
Tryna be at the wrong place at the right time
But I know what's mine when I see it
My cousin said I made it big and it's unusual
She tried to take a selfie at my Grandma's funeral
Used to roam on Queen, now I sing Queen Street anthems
Used to hate attention, now I pull up in that wagon
And I was broken, I was broken, I was so broke
I used to roam around the town when I was homeless
Me and Lamar would rob a nigga for his Jordans
And flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix
Now we get faded when we want, girl, we got choices
Lay them on the fuckin' table, we got choices
And if they wanna fuck my niggas, they got choices
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I get it on the low
Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill
Life so trill 
Life so trill 
I let you down, I led you on
I never thought I'd be here without you
Don't let me drown inside your arms
Bad thoughts inside my mind
When the darkness comes, you're my light, baby
My light, baby, my light when it's dark, yeah
I'm too high, baby, too high, baby
'Cause I know right now, that I lost it 
It's way too late to save our souls, baby 
It's way too late, we're on our own 
I made mistakes, I did you wrong, baby 
It's way too late to save my—
I can't trust  where I live  anymore 
Sources say  that we're done , how would they know? 
We're in Hell, it's disguised as a paradise with flashing lights
I just wanna believe there's so much more 
It's way too late to save our souls, baby 
It's way too late, we're on our own 
I made mistakes, I did you wrong, baby 
It's way too late to save my—
And, ooh, I tell myself I should get over you
I said, ooh, I know I'd rather be all over you trying, trying, but I, I just want your body
Ridin' slow on top of me, girl, on top of me
I want you, babe, ooh-ooh
It's way too late  to save our souls, baby 
It's way too late, we're on our own 
I made mistakes , I did you wrong, baby 
It's way too late to save my, my—

>>>Twenty Eight The Weeknd

This house is not a home to you
But you decide to go ahead and lay down, lay down
There are no words to describe the depth of your indifference
’Cause I see you’re here to stay
Should’ve known to pick my fate 
I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong
To let you in my home
Now you know where I sleep
Hey there, lonely girl
Did you have to tell your friends
About  the way I got you screaming my name?
Did you have to tell the world?
Now your girls all wanna fuck
Girl you could’ve been the one
Gotta change my number twice a month
When you could have simply kept it on the down low
I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong
To let you in my home
Now you know where I sleep
Baby if I knew you’d be living in my sheets
I wouldn’t have shown you any love
I would have left you in the club
You said you don’t belong
You keep saying there’s no one
And there’s no where to go
But who keeps calling on your phone?
I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong
I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong
To let you in my home
Now you know where I sleep
I’m so wrong, I’m so wrong
To let you in my home
Now you know where I sleep
Girl, if your man call your phone again
Girl, if your man call your phone again

And bad girls go everywhere
And tonight I will love you
And tomorrow you won't care
I leave it all to you
Let it come to you
Precious little, precious little diamond
I leave it all to you
Let it come to you
You're in love with something bigger than love
You believe in something stronger than trust
Don't you shy away from me
Just sacrifice your every last inhibition
I'm on your side
Is the only time we'll have each other
Why would you try to waste this precious time?
'Cause tonight, we'll be right here
And tomorrow you won't care

>>>7 Things Miley Cyrus
<sos>
I probably shouldn't say this, but at times, I get so scared
When I think about the previous relationship we shared
It was awesome, but we lost it
It's not possible for me not to care
And now we're standin' in the rain
But nothing's ever gonna change until you hear, my dear
The seven things I hate about you
The seven things I hate about you, oh, you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends, they're jerks
When you act like them, just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you
It's awkward and silent as I wait for you to say
But what I need to hear now, your sincere apology
When you mean it, I'll believe it
If you text it, I'll delete it
Let's be clear 
Oh, I'm not comin' back
You're taking seven steps here
The seven things I hate about you
You're vain, your games, you're insecure
You love me, you like her
You make me laugh, you make me cry
I don't know which side to buy
Your friends, they're jerks
When you act like them, just know it hurts
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I hate the most that you do
You make me love you
And compared to all the great things
That would take too long to write
I probably should mention the seven that I like
The seven things I like about you
Your hair, your eyes, your old Levi's
When we kiss, I'm hypnotized
You make me laugh, you make me cry
But I guess that's both I'll have to buy
Your hand in mine
When we're intertwined, everything's alright
I wanna be with the one I know
And the seventh thing I like the most that you do
You make me love you

I'm everything they said I would be
I'll put you down slow, love you goodbye
Before you let go, just one more time
Take off your clothes, pretend that it's fine
A little more hurt won't kill you
Tonight, mother says you don't look happy
I know that you're wrong for me
Gonna wish we never met on the day I leave
I brought you down to your knees
'Cause they say that misery loves company
It's not your fault I ruin everything
And it's not your fault I can't be what you need

>>>BB Talk Miley Cyrus

Alright, so this is really fucked up, but
Alright, I was sleeping next to him but I was dreaming about the other dude
And then all of a sudden, everything that he fucking did just made me cringe and it was so hard to fall in but so easy just to fall back right out again
This whole time, I could give to you and I could paint you pictures but I guess I could just never write a song and then maybe I'd never fell out of love with him in the first place
I mean, I, I don't wanna feel this feeling cause my energy's just so strong that, I don't know if I'm creating this or this is actually what is meant to be
And you know that, they say that you gotta think what you want into existence, but you know, I haven't been too good at making decisions so, I have no idea what the fuck I want, I guess
You're giving me a feeling in my head
Laying in my bed just thinking
Not really feeling like the one I want
Takes everything in me not to call him
I really, really, really want it, too
I told all my friends I'm moving on
Your baby talk is creeping me out
Fuck me so you stop baby talking
You know what, in the beginning it was like we were fucking homies and shit and then all of a sudden you started with some fucking baby goo-goo tongue down my fucking throat
I mean, even in front of your mom
Dude, as if I'm not fucking awkward enough
I mean, you put me in these fucking situations where I look like a dumbass bitch and I'm not a fucking dumbass bitch
You know, like, I hate all that fucking PDA, I probably hate it more than your fucking friends do
You know, it's sweet and you couldn't be more opposite of my last dickhead but, you know I just, I don't know if I can get over the fucking goo
You keep saying again and again
We're laying in my bed just talking
And now I, now I can't hold it back
I'm feeling like I'm gonna vomit
I don't really wanna let go of you
I heard I change my mind way too often
Your baby talk is creeping me out
Fuck me so you stop baby talking
Alright, so, I'm gonna be honest
It's the super cutey shit, that's the main issue here
I mean, I'm fucking what?
Look, I like when you send me, you know, the, the queen emoji, but when I send back the monkey, you know, the ones with the, the hands over the eyes? That means that shit's just getting a little too weird for me
I mean, I don't wanna say it in person, I just bury my head in your armpit which... weirdly smells good and your hair and your fucking teeth
Like, why the fuck would I wanna lick your teeth but I do
And remember there was that one time that I had like a 15 minute...
Well, that was kind of the best thing in the entire world
You know, maybe I could just get past this shit and I could get used to someone giving a fuck
I'm sorry I called you a creep and that thing about the vomit
I mean, look, I'm really starting to be in this whole thing, but no matter what you do, homegirl can't handle the fucking goo
Fuck me so you'll stop baby talking
I don't really wanna get over you
I heard I change my mind way too often
Baby talk is creeping me out
Fuck me so you'll stop baby talking

And I'm holding on

We're gonna stay out, gonna break some hearts
We're gonna dance 'til the dance floor falls apart

We're gonna have some fun, gonna lose control
It feels so good

You tucked me in, turned out the light
Kept me safe and sound at night
Little girls depend on things like that
Brushed my teeth and combed my hair
Had to drive me everywhere
You were always there when I looked back
You had to do it all alone
Make a living, make a home
Must have been as hard as it could be
And when I couldn't sleep at night
Scared things wouldn't turn out right
You would hold my hand and sing to me
Caterpillar in the tree
How you wonder who you'll be
Can't go far, but you can always dream
Wish you may and wish you might
Don't you worry, hold on tight
I promise you there will come a day

Girl, there will come a time , this is where you wanna be
H-O-M-E , satisfaction guaranteed
And now, it's comes your time , this is where you wanna be

And you know we're gonna be alright
We'll be sleeping on a red-eye flight
Keep up with me 'til the end of the night
And we're just gettin' started
Always last to leave the party
Drugs rule everything around me
Wake up with new tattoos on my body
Drugs rule everything around me
Hit the Goose, raise a toast, pop the molly
I can go toe-to-toe, like I'm Ali
We're all tryna fill the lonely
Drugs rule everything around me
These planes are all UFOs
And this city's in outer space
It's better than where we came from
I think that we both should stay
'Cause you know we're gonna be alright
We'll be fucking on a red-eye flight
Keep up with me 'til the end of the night

Hit the ghost, raise a toast, pop the molly

Drugs rule everything around me
You could call me a king
I got it all in my store, you should crown me
Purple Perc, sticky green mollies, sippy lean
Got the white that's sure to light the floor like in "Billie Jean"

Was it something I said or something I did?
Did my words not come out right?
Though I tried not to hurt you
But I guess that's why they say...
Every rose has its thorn
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn
I listen to our favorite song, playing on the radio
Hear the DJ say love's a game of easy come and easy go
But I wonder, does he know?
Has he ever felt like this?
And I know that you'd be here right now
If I, I could let you know somehow
Every rose has its thorn 
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song
Every rose has its thorn
Though it's been a while now, I can still feel so much pain
Like a knife that cuts you, the wound heals
But that scar, that scar remains 
Every rose, every rose
Every rose has its thorn
I know I could've saved a love that night
If I'd known what to say
Instead of makin' love, we both made our separate ways
And now I hear you found somebody new
And that I never meant that much to you
And to hear that tears me up inside
And to see you cuts me like a knife
Every rose has its thorn 
Just like every night has its dawn
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song

I can take myself dancing
And I can hold my own hand
Yeah, I can love me better than you can
Can love me better, I can love me better, baby
Paint my nails cherry-red
Match the roses that you left
No remorse, no regret
I forgive every word you said

If you were my boyfriend, I'd be true to you
If I make a promise, I'm coming through

>>>Girls Just Want to Have Fun Miley Cyrus
<sos>
So they booked Krome vs Young America for World Domination
Shit, Gully, you're the man
This like the best match-up you could book for 30 grand
But before I start, I want to mention something
Cause shit's getting redundant
So let me bring this up, before you get to the subject
Yeah I'm French, and what I lack in vocab I make up for with substance
This my second language, and dude still get left buried in punches
So you got French jokes? They all do
You should call me a frog too
Think that shit'll work? Not on me, I'm the wrong dude
And I let that shit fly; You frog food
So fuck the jokes, cause they paid to see this
And the frogs got the bodies covered like the plagues of Egypt
They put a bottom feeder, verse a great behemoth
So trip and get rocked faster than Schumacher, try take a ski trip
And if y'all noticed the accent, then your thoughts missing
As soon as I start spitting, it's easy to tell who really talk different
So let's talk JeFF, we only fuck with you because your E. Farrell's pocket puppy
We don't care about your dope rhymes, we woudn't give you credit
You've been on a roll, but only got your drive from a cosign
You're not a rapper, you're a con, an actor
Your humour's what's sought after
And we know Farrell helped out with the bars: he Jon Taffer
So they said I can't win this battle, they were wrong though
I came to turn JeFF to a John Doe
I'm known to shit on a GZ rapper, I'm Sean Zo
The fans thought I was gone, but they brought me back in the Six: I'm Jon Snow
The two-piece too sweet, get hit with a combo
Better guard your chin, I'll scar your grin if your arms low
And inevitably, this is where the gun talk come into convo
The cannon in my hand, you get hit with it pronto
I'll stretch skin on a barrel like I'm making a bongo
And when it comes to GZ Toronto, I make magic out these raps like Bismack Biyombo
And that's round 1
So Gully, sent me a carrier pigeon
Said "You want on World Dom?"
I sent one back, saying "You already know, let's go"
"Who you got in mind for the kid?" He sent one back, it said Krome
I killed the bird
Toronto rock with me more than you, I'm comfortable as it gets
I'm really loving the 6ix, like you when you started cuffing your bitch
I'm running this shit, you didn't earn this spot, there's something different
What is it? Enough privilege? I mean let's be real
Canada's desperate for new talent, just is what it is
That's why Gully's pushing Krome like 20-inch rims
You're a nobody, I get new fans every event
You sketching, trying to ride off my movement
You don't get views, like Tidal music
That's an ITunes exclusive
I got a buzz like the first day of bootcamp
So why would I do this?
Only I could beat me, I ain't lying/lion that's just the pride that I move with
But what more can I say?
He gone regret getting a shot like Gordon Bombay
You still use put him in a box bars
Your punches/punch is outdated like the fighting Irish
I'm futuristic, my voice alone got them spinning in the chair, like Miley Cyrus
You be the judge, I'm from America, so why/Y he getting Xed if Krome is home?
You got no fans, well I even got a pump from the trailer like Lil G's first mobile home
So don't make me go flex like Post Malone
So muscular, I got better traps than Kevin McCallister in Home Alone
And you ain't shooting me, your gluten free
If he had to choose one GZ division to ride for, he'd choose the D
You got two dads and a girls name; Maxine
I been that thug
You been a bitch, your senior quote was "Live, laugh, love"
I found his yearbook
It ain't a gameboy/game boy get a cartridge in the back if I'm holding the tec/tech
Or I'll pull out a blade, and you'll catch a buck fifty, like Pokemon Red
I only battle on the road, we ain't rolling the same
If you came to L.A., this bitch would be running out the Bunker, like Cloverfield Lane
I am better than you, I did fuck your bitch, you can never slap the shit out me
But go ahead and try tell them something they don't know about me
So JeFF, you said Canadians don't have guns
And for that statement, this round we gone have fun
Cause when I said I'm a different kind of rapper, I was lying
I'm generic as fuck and I got gun lines for days
So I hope you expect these shots and they ain't candid
Got shooters that'll clap for nothing; they plane-landing
Rapid fire, lead from the magmum
The chain on the revolver spit more than JeFF when he rapping
Leaving him wet, I don't see no man as a threat
This ratchet dumped on more losers than a Bachelorette
What I conceal will blow half his face
And make his cap easy to peel like masking tape
And you like to talk shit online? Well I'm off that
I came to talk shit to your face, and you can't blog that
Still got the dot for him/Dot Forum if he talk back/TalkBack
And you died verse Foreman you ain't all that
So let's battle for World Dom
Think you gone win today? You dead wrong
America ain't lose this bad since Vietnam
I won't run up on JeFF with tecs drawn, it's Rob Furlong
Canadian kill-shot, a thousand metres out I'm a savage sniper
Let one buck on his cap like Jägermeister
So keep a heater tuck, then get your Caesar cut
And then I'm cold in the box; Reefer truck
Homie you're weak as fuck
Foreman sent me nudes of your girl, that bitch fat but she sexy
Shit, started to tap me I had a plan like Russell Brand; I'mma stroke her walls after smoking her JeFFrey
So go head, pass me a soda; Preferably Pepsi
Last Canadian this nice y'all heard of was Gretzky
So thinking this an easy win, JeFF bugging
Head brush him, like he the only name on the card; McLovin
I wish Laugh N' Stalk killed you, or even just said something
Instead he chose to dummy talk and look at how JeFF done him/Jeff Dunham
But this ain't a flashback, and I'm nothing to laugh at
And next round I'mm talk to your soul
And excuse my French; It always comes off when I'm talking to hoes
Congratulations you little flappy headed fuck
That round your French accent actually sounded tough
But, you ain't my fwend buddy
And I ain't your buddy pal
My type? Fly; Aerial
Your type? Comic Sans; Your type funny style
You've got a resting bitch face
That matches the rest of your bitch life
Your girlfriend eats you out, pussy; Yeh that bitch dyke
But I'm off it, my gun on the first date with a bitch
It can't wait to bang, we on different planes
This kid light up a room like Stranger Things
You ain't strapped, you never raise your led like cursive penmanship
Nice try for World Dom, but war with an American, the .45 is the end of shit
I got a Smith N Wesson from Mass
I got a Colt from Connecticut
I got a Remington from New York
I got a... You don't need to hear the rest of it
But don't test it kid
It ain't fake like wrestling man
I got a chrome magnum, that'll leave Krome's cap looking chrome magnum
Not cause he barbaric, cause he'll find his body in the dirt when I toe-tag him, bitch!
You don't want to tangle with this cat
This ain't opposite to track
It's like A Goofy Movie, why?
Because I brought macs across the country lets see if your dogs popping back
I leave your city in ruins like Sodom McMore
I'm more fire than a spire when it rock at the door
I drink a lot, my liver shot like Bas Rutten
I fucking raw, I've probably got something viral like cop shootings
My life? They compare it to movies
Cause I rose from the concrete and started pedalling white girl like American Beauty
I run shit, you never done shit
But fuck up every card Gully put you on on some Dunsh shit
I'm a pimp, my game got bras off and cups dropping like a party found
When you try kick it with bitches you always fall for a trick like Charlie Brown
Yeah... Your girl a hoe, she got a big face like the Easter Island
Before I fucked her she gave me a little head like the Zika Virus
I'm sick baby, if I get to clapping a handgun
I'm gone be taking son/sun out like the National Anthem
So I went on Google Chrome, and googled "Krome"
And guess what came up? A link to download Google Chrome
Alright JeFF, so this the third round and I'ma talk to you
Cause they told you your the best ever
Sold you a dream, and made you believe, but no matter how many people you fool
You'll never reach the top, it's like a pyramid scheme
So you act like you got no, love for the scene
And your better than everybody, and the fans are all sheep
Like you resent the culture
You don't want us to see that
Just step away from the mic if you're annoyed by the feedback
The nerve of you, calling other rappers copy-cats
You sound like Farrell and Bangz at the fusion dance
I don't want to hear you rant or preach originality with a style that you revend
I can't blame you, or even shame your rapping
You went from annoying hype man to the main attraction
Teaming up with Farrell really caused a chain reaction
But your stuck in the shadow now, and you can't get past it
Young America, repping the states all fly and cocky
Till he land in the wrong place, fuck around and get killed
If he says the iron pop; it's Ryan Lockton
We know this American lying about the steel
And, get beat to death I believe in violence
Cave in the kid's head like the Zika Virus
Till the afterlife, when you meet Osiris
And you get your face rocked; like Easter Island
So I got this battle with JeFFrey covered
After this? I don't think JeFF recover
He'll be acting like a bitch; That's Young Thug on a Jeffery cover
So putting money on JeFF? Nothing short of a gamble
The odds of that? About the same as Dunsh showing up for a battle
So I'm off the hype
When they say JeFFrey fire now, it comes across as "Clips 3-0" or "Arsonal never lost"
We don't believe that shit
It's just a funny way to talk, cause your a clown and...
This is entertainment after all but, I guess this is how I end my last round
And on the upside me and, ah, I'm homies with Frak now
Ladies and gentleman, I'm glad we about to get this on camera
I'm about to give you a brief history lesson on America and Canada
But first, let's take it back to the first humans to ever exist
The date? July 4th, 1776!
Sitting by a fire which was dimly lit
Thomas Jefferson had an epiphany
He was like "Yo I'm tired of this birdish shit
So he picked up his nine, got Benjamin Franklin on the phone
He's like "It's time for war"
Ben' was like "Let's go!"
So they hit up Eurgh
Or, whoever the leader of "OK Britain" was
And they said "what's up?"
"You gone give us our freedom, or we gone take it, what's up?"
They were like "Can this wait till after tea time, y'all sound proper mad"
Thomas was like "Eh, too late there's a nuke on the way, you gone get it bad"
Boom, boom, this happened, boom
Our education systems again; Boom
So the new kid, there's dead children and women everywhere
But waiting is scarier...
Some of them survived, but nuclear fallouts' why most of them today look like Simpsons characters
But, armed with watercress sandwiches and crumpets, they're naval fleet was already on the way
They got news that the queen was dead, they were gonna make us pay
So they showed up on the East Coast like "Let's get it cracking"
Thomas Jefferson flew by on a dragon
So since British soldiers are only trained to stand completely still
That's what they did, they all got killed!
Except for one of them
Slightly above retarded, aborted
Then he swam all the way to the Canadian shore
His name? Tim Horton!
So Tim Horton found Canada
Then, he fucked a maple tree
But fast forward - we don't learn about other countries
Fast forward to the day
Recently, the Montreal Expos changed to the Washington National
That just shows your city's heavy hitters would rather be down with America's capitol
Cause the U.S. is the best, no debate that's factual
We're diverse and violent, y'all soft and wetter than tuna casserole
It don't even matter what state you in
We lock kids behind bars like a baby crib
What's crazy is we wouldn't change for shit
And by the way, Young America for the chain, let's make GZ great again

>>>Heart of Glass Miley Cyrus
<sos>
Once had a love and it was a gas
It soon turned out, had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Much o' mistrust, love's gone behind
Once had a love and it was divine
I soon found out that I was losing my mind
It seemed like the real thing, I was so blind
Much o' mistrust, love's gone behind
What I find is pleasing and I'm feeling fine
Love is so confusing, there's no peace of mind
If I fear I'm losing you, it's just no good
You teasing like you do
Once had a love, it was a gas
It soon turned out, had a heart of glass
Seemed like the real thing, only to find
Much o' mistrust, love's gone behind
Adorable illusion and I cannot hide
I'm the one you're using, please don't push me aside
We could've made it cruising, ooh, yeah
Yeah, riding high on love's true bluish light

Call me up, let me know that you got this message that I'm leaving for you

You used to call me your angel
Said I was sent straight down from heaven
You'd hold me close in your arms
I loved the way you felt so strong
I never wanted you to leave
I wanted you to stay here holdin' me
I miss you, I miss your smile
And I still shed a tear every once in a while
And even though it's different now
You're still here somehow
My heart won't let you go
And I need you to know
I miss you, sha-la-la-la-la, I miss you
You used to call me your dreamer
And now I'm livin' out my dream
Oh, how I wish you could see
Everything that's happening for me
I'm thinking back on the past
It's true that time is flyin' by too fast
I miss you, I miss your smile

>>>I Thought I Lost You Miley Cyrus
<sos>
Nobody listens to me
Don't hear a single thing I've said
Say anything to soothe me
Anything to get you from my head
Don't know how really I feel
'Cause it's the faith that makes it like I don't care
Don't know how much it hurts to turn around like you were never there
Like somehow you could be replaced
And I could walk away from the promises we made
And swore we'd never break
I thought I lost you when you ran away to try to find me
I thought I'd never see your sweet face again
I turned around and you were gone, and on, and on the days went
But I kept the moments that we were in
'Cause I hoped in my heart, you'd come back to me, my friend
And now I got you
But I thought I lost you
I felt so empty out there
And there were days I had my doubts
But I knew I'd find you somewhere
Because I knew I couldn't live without you in my life for one more day
And I swore I'd never break a promise that we made
I thought I lost you when you ran away to try to find me
I thought I'd never see your sweet face again
I turned around and you were gone, and on, and on the days went
But I kept the moments that we were in
'Cause I hoped in my heart, you'd come back to me, my friend
And now I got you
But I thought I lost you
I told myself I wouldn't sleep 'til I searched the world from sea to sea
I made a wish upon a star
I turned around, and there you were
And now here we are, are
I thought I lost you 
I thought I lost you 
I thought I lost you when you ran away to try to find me
I thought I'd never see your sweet face again
I turned around and you were gone, and on, and on the days went
But I kept the moments that we were in
'Cause I hoped in my heart, you'd come back to me, my friend
And now I got you
But I thought I lost you
I thought I lost you 
So glad I got you, got you
So glad I got you, yeah, yeah
I thought I lost you

>>>Inspired Miley Cyrus
<sos>
I'm writing down my dreams, all I'd like to see
Starting with the bees or else they're gonna die
There will be no trees or air for us to breathe
I start feeling mad, but then I feel inspired
Thinkin' about the days
Coming home with dirty feet from playing with my dad
All day in the creek
He somehow has a way of knowing what to say
So when I'm feeling sad, he makes me feel inspired
We are meant for more
You're the handle on the door that opens up to change
I know it sounds so strange
To think we are meant for more
You're the handle on the door that opens up the change
I know that sounds so strange
Because you always felt so small, but know you aren't at all
And I hope you feel inspired
Oh, I hope you feel inspired
How can we escape all the fear and all the hate?
Is anyone watching us down here?
Death is life, it's not a curse
Reminds us of time and what it's worth
To make the most out of it while we're here
We are meant for more
You're the handle on the door that opens up to change
I know it sounds so strange
We are meant for more
There's a lock upon the door, but we hold the key to change
But how can we escape all the fear and all the hate?
Is anyone watching us down here?

>>>Jaded Miley Cyrus
<sos>
I don't wanna call and talk too long
I know it was wrong, but never said I was sorry
Now I've had time to think it over
We're much older and the bone's too big to bury
Oh, isn't it a shame that it ended like that?
Said goodbye forever, but you never unpacked
We went to Hell, but we never came back
I'm sorry that you're jaded
I could've taken you places
You're lonely now and I hate it
I'm sorry that you're jaded
You're not even willin' to look at your part
You just jump in the car and head down to thе bar 'til you're blurry
Don't know when to stop, so you take it too far
I don't know whеre you are and I'm left in the dark 'til I'm worried
Ooh, and it hurts me
And it's a fuckin' shame that it ended like that
You broke your own heart, but you'd never say that
We went to Hell, but we never came back
I'm sorry that you're jaded 
I could've taken you places 
You're lonely now and I hate it
I'm sorry that you're jaded
I won't lie, it won't be easy
When somebody new is on your body
I'll change my number but keep your T-shirt
I don't mind it's torn up and faded
I'm sorry that you're jaded 
I could've taken you places 
You're lonely now and I hate it
I'm sorry that you're jaded
I'm sorry that you're jaded

Your smile is like a breath of spring
Your skin is soft like summer rain

And I can easily understand
How you could easily take my man
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene

Please don't take him even though you can
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene

And even when you think it can't
It finds a way to still push on, though
Sometime you wanna run away
Ain't got the patience for the pain

If you fall, dust it off, don't let up

Through it all, just stand up!
Ooh, it's like we all had better days
Problems getting all up in your face
Just because you go through it
Don't mean you gotta take control, no-oh-oh
You ain't gotta find no hiding place
Because the heart can beat the hate
Don't wanna let the mind keep playin' you
And sayin' you can't go on
I'm tellin' you, things get better, through whatever
If you fall, dust it off, don't let up

If you fall, dust it off
You can live your life 
Let your heart be your guide 
And you will know that you're good if you trust in the good
Everything will be alright, yeah 
Light up the dark if you follow your heart
And it will get better

But the heart keeps telling you don't give up 
Who are we to be questioning, wondering what is what?

>>>Malibu Miley Cyrus
<sos>
I never came to the beach or stood by the ocean
I never sat by the shore under the sun with my feet in the sand
But you brought me here and I'm happy that you did
'Cause now I'm as free as birds catchin' the wind
I always thought I would sink, so I never swam
I never went boatin', don't get how they are floatin'
And sometimes I get so scared of what I can't understand
But here I am, next to you
The sky's more blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you 
We watched the sun go down as we were walkin'
I'd spend the rest of my life just standing here talkin'
You would explain the current as I just smile
Hoping that you'll stay the same and nothing will change
And it'll be us just for a while, do they even exist?
That's when I make a wish to swim away with the fish
'Cause it's supposed to be this hot all summer long
I never would've believed you if three years ago you told me
I'd be here writing this song
But here I am, next to you
The sky's so blue in Malibu
Next to you in Malibu
Next to you 
The sky's so blue in Malibu 
Next to you 
We are just like the waves that flow back and forth
Sometimes I feel like I'm drowning and you're there to save me
And I wanna thank you with all of my heart
It's a brand new start, a dream come true in Malibu

La, la, la-la, la
Yeah, it's been a long night and the mirror's telling me to go home
But it's been a long time since I felt this good on my own 
Lotta years went by with my hands tied up in your ropes 
Forever and ever, no more 
The midnight sky is the road I'm takin'
Head high up in the clouds 
I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you 
Fire in my lungs, can't bite the devil on my tongue, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you
See my lips on her mouth, everybody's talkin' now, baby
Ooh, you know it's true 
That I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you 
La, la, la-la, la
She got her hair pulled back 'cause the sweat's drippin' off of her face 
Said, "It ain't so bad if I wanna make a couple mistakes"
You should know right now that I never stay put in one place
Forever and ever, no more 
The midnight sky is the road I'm takin'
Head high up in the clouds 
I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you 
Fire in my lungs, can't bite the devil on my tongue, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you
See my lips on her mouth, everybody's talkin' now, baby
Ooh, you know it's true 
That I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you 
I don't hide blurry eyes like you
I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you 
Fire in my lungs, can't bite the devil on my tongue, you know
I don't need to be loved by you
See his hands 'round my waist, thought you'd never be replaced, baby
Ooh, you know it's true 
That I was born to run, I don't belong to anyone, oh no
I don't need to be loved by you 
La, la, la-la, la
You know it's true, you know it's true
>>>Nothing Breaks Like a Heart Miley Cyrus
<sos>
This world can hurt you
It cuts you deep and leaves a scar
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
And nothing breaks like a heart
I heard you on the phone last night
We live and die by pretty lies
You know it, oh, we both know it
These silver bullet cigarettes
This burning house, there's nothing left
It's smoking, we both know it
We got all night to fall in love
But just like that, we fall apart
We're broken, we're broken
Mmm, well, nothing, nothing, nothing gonna save us now
Well, there's broken silence
By thunder crashing in the dark 
And this broken record
Spin endless circles in the bar 
This world can hurt you
It cuts you deep and leaves a scar
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
Mhmm, and nothing breaks like a heart
We'll leave each other cold as ice
And high and dry, the desert wind
Is blowin', is blowin'
Remember what you said to me?
We were drunk in love in Tennessee
And I hold it, we both know it
Mmm, that nothing, nothing, nothing gonna save us now
Nothing, nothing, nothing gonna save us now
Well, there's broken silence
By thunder crashing in the dark 
And this broken record
Spin endless circles in the bar 
This world can hurt you
It cuts you deep and leaves a scar
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
Mmm, and nothing breaks like a heart
Nothing breaks like a heart
Mmm, and nothing breaks like a heart
My heart, my heart
Well, nothing, nothing, nothing gonna save us now
My heart, my heart
Nothing, nothing, nothing gonna save us now
Well, there's broken silence
By thunder crashing in the dark 
And this broken record
Spin endless circles in the bar 
This world can hurt you
It cuts you deep and leaves a scar
Things fall apart, but nothing breaks like a heart
Mmm, but nothing breaks like a heart
But nothing breaks like a heart
Mmm, but nothing breaks like a heart

>>>Nothing to Lose Miley Cyrus

Who de 
Who de, who de, who de
Who de, who de, who de, who de trust
I raid in my car, pop a four to the five 
Making new banger we can’t sleep at night 
If u bee my twizzi be ready to flight
Smoked pure gas maybe turn off the light 
Opps on my block broski ready to fight 
You owe me my money came crib at late night 
Wе making the robbery or homiside 
I camе with Drako make noise, outside
I’m in, and I am wanna supply 
Feel Like a Bigge and Pac in his prime, I not gonna lie
Ween I drop my album be ready to die
U know its High Quality do not deny 
Do not deny, u listen High Quality know Is my time 
This lines as fatality - Warrior Shrine 
Ice on me, Sub Zero - say rip to ur spine 
Who de trust, all I need now if you tell me who u trust 
If u won’t to talk somebody, turn to dust 
Know that you not first, but you can be the last 
Tell me who you gonna trust and do it fast
Who de trust 
Who de , who de , who de , who de trust
Double suspicion from police as Kodak 
Rhymes like Brutality in Mortal Kombat 
Album is gonna be dope, and you know that 
Ballin like Roddy, I just can't now go back 
I just can't now go back cause changed my views 
We can't falling down, we got nothing to lose 
Feeling so lonely, like lyrics in blues 
Ride with some sticks and I ready to use
I am ready to use and feel like my money up 
Making first album, now look like manic 
Finished the track crib be ready i turn it up
Shit sound so good, but i wanna make flawlessed off
Buying new benzo track, some rappers lame as fuck
Rhymes is not so good man I think didn't do enough
We wanna be high as fuck
See something shit gonna fell into double cup 
Splash at some sauce, but she’s got ”nostylist” 
Wanna be lonely, not like Billie Eilish
Bars are so soft, like they made for childish
Lines in your head, now ur catching new virus
Living Two life not like Miley Cyrus
”Low life”, get High, on weekend, lost gyrus
Damage my health, good habits on minus
Ain’t greatest yet, but rhymes make me highness

>>>Party in the U.S.A. Miley Cyrus

I hopped off the plane at LAX
With a dream and my cardigan
Welcome to the land of fame excess 
Am I gonna fit in?
Jumped in the cab, here I am for the first time
Look to my right, and I see the Hollywood sign
This is all so crazy
Everybody seems so famous
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the taxi man turned on the radio
And a JAY-Z song was on
So I put my hands up
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, "Yeah"
Movin' my hips like, "Yeah"
I got my hands up, they're playin' my song
I know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A. 
Get to the club in my taxi cab
Everybody's lookin' at me now
Like, "Who's that chick that's rockin' kicks?
She gotta be from out of town"
So hard with my girls not around me
It's definitely not a Nashville party
'Cause all I see are stilettos
I guess I never got the memo
My tummy's turnin' and I'm feelin' kinda homesick
Too much pressure and I'm nervous
That's when the DJ dropped my favorite tune
And a Britney song was on
So I put my hands up
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, "Yeah"
Movin' my hips like, "Yeah"
I got my hands up, they're playin' my song
I know I'm gonna be okay
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A. 
Feel like hopping on a flight 
Back to my hometown tonight 
Something stops me every time 
The DJ plays my song and I feel alright 
So I put my hands up
They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away
I'm noddin' my head like, "Yeah" 
Movin' my hips like, "Yeah" 
I got my hands up, they're playin' my song
I know I'm gonna be okay 
Yeah , it's a party in the U.S.A. 
Yeah, it's a party in the U.S.A.

They're playin' my song, the butterflies fly away 
I'm noddin' my head like, "Yeah"

She's gotta do what she's gotta do
And I've gotta like it or not
She's got dreams too big for this town
And she needs to give 'em a shot
Looks like I'm all ready to leave
Nothing left to pack
Ain't no room for me in that car
Even if she asked me to tag along 
God, I gotta be strong
I'm at the starting line of the rest of my life
As ready as I ever been
Got the hunger and the stars in my eyes
The prize is mine to win
She's waiting on my blessings
Before she hits that open road
But baby, get ready 
Looks like things are falling in place
Feels like they're falling apart
I painted this big old smile on my face
To hide my broken heart
If only she knew
This is where you don't say what you want so bad to say
This is where I want to but I won't get in the way
Of her and her dreams
And spreading her wings 
I'm at the starting line of the rest of my life
As ready as I ever been
Got the hunger and the stars in my eyes
The prize is mine to win
She's waiting on my blessings
Before she hits that open road 
But baby, get ready 
Get set 
I'm at the starting line of the rest of my life
As ready as I ever been 
Got the hunger and the stars in my eyes
The prize is mine to win 
She's waiting on my blessings
Before she hits that open road
But baby, get ready 
Let me go now, I'm ready
I'll be alright, I'll be okay
You know that I'll be thinking of you
Each and every day
She's gotta do what she's gotta do
Let me go now
She's gotta do what she's gotta do
I gotta do what I gotta do

Why did we go all the way?
What do we do, oh, when it rains?
When the sun dies and the stars fade from view
Our love will remain real and true
Through the distant  and cold depths of space 
The radio sings our song , it's a love real and true
Hold on, hold on, hold up, Future, what the fuck you doin'?
You can annihilate way more chicks than the chick you screwin'
You on top of your game, homie, man you a star
You got real bitches, they love that nigga that you are
They say you're like Jimi Hendrix, in his early twenties
You in Vegas, you supposed to be with a snow bunny
You a player, huh, you wanna come around and save her
Keep it trill, you lovin' her just as much as your career
You mad ill, I knew you'd be the one to keep it real
And I can't even lie, dog, when I see y'all it gives me chills
And Imma stand behind y'all because I know the way you live
Aye just do me this favor, you give it time, time reveals
When the sun dies and the stars fade from view
Our love will remain real and true
Through the distant and cold depths of space
The radio sings our song, it's a love real and true
We've been in the same place, for a long, long time
If our hearts go the wrong way, I still know you're mine
Should we even try to fight it?
If our love is trapped in all ways
I know that things been rough
But when you're by my side
It's more than enough, yeah
For us to make it through the test of time
When the sun dies  and the stars fade from view 
Our love will remain real and true
Through the distant  and cold depths of space
The radio sings our song, it's a love real and true
Standin' in the middle of humility
Can't nobody never love you more than me
If love is all you need, I'm all you'll ever need
I can never be scared of commitment
I can prevail through life without bein' malicious
I can't hold you for responsible for your mischiefs
I hope you are never huntin' me with vengeance
I'm not predictin' anything, I'm just listenin'
Congratulations, you made it, you coulda missed it
And I'm acceptin' your past but forgiveness
And with all the mistakes I've made, you're still listenin'
When the sun dies  and the stars fade from view 
Our love will remain real and true
Through the distant  and cold depths of space 
The radio sings our song , it's a love real and true

I got a new dress just to meet you downtown
Can you walk me through the park just to show it off?
I can pull my hair back in that tight way that you like
If you wrap me in your arms and never stop
Heart beats so loud that it's drownin’ me out
Livin' in an April shower
You're pourin’ down, baby, drown me out 
You're just like a river 
You go on forever
You're just like a river
Blowing bubbles in the bath, I can't stop from thinking lately
You could be the one, have the honor of my babies
Hope they have your eyes and that crooked smile
Was a desеrt 'fore I met you, I was in a drought
Heart bеats so loud that it's drownin' me out
Livin’ in an April shower
You’re pourin' down, baby, drown me out 
You’re just like a river 
You're just like a river 
You go on forever
You're just like a river
You're never runnin’ dry 
I feel you everywhere
Your face is all in my hair 
Covered up in your sweat
It turns me on that you care, baby
Your love, it flows just like a river
You're just like a river 
You're just like a river
You're just like a river 
You're just like a river 
You go on forever

Now I can't wait to see you again
I've got a way of knowin' when something is right
I feel like I must've known you in another life
'Cause I felt this deep connection
When you looked in my eyes
 Now I can't wait to see you again
The last time I freaked out
I just kept looking down
I st-st-stuttered when you asked me what I'm thinking 'bout
Felt like I couldn't breathe
You asked what's wrong with me

The next time we hang out, I will redeem myself
My heart, it can't rest 'til then
I, I can't wait to see you again
I got this crazy feelin' deep inside
When you called and asked to see me tomorrow night
I'm not a mind reader, but I'm reading the signs

Once upon a time, it was paradise
Once upon a time, I was paralyzed
Think I'm gonna miss these harbor lights
But it's time to let it go
Once upon a time, it was made for us
Woke up one day, it had turned to dust
Baby, we were found, but now we're lost
So it's time to let it go
I want my house in the hills
Don't want the whiskey and pills
I don't give up easily
But I don't think I'm down
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, la-la-la, you'll slide away
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, I'll go back to the city lights
So won't you slide away?
Back to the ocean, la-la-la, you'll slide away
Once upon a time, it was paradise

Woke up one day, it had turned to dust
Baby, we were found, but now we're lost
So it's time to let it go
Move on, we're not seventeen

You say that everything changed
You're right, we're grown now
So won't you slide away?

In such a crazy tide
It's sooner than I thought
But you called me out
I lost control and there's no doubt
I'm gonna start all over
Out of the fire and into the fire again
You make me want to forget

Another chance to get burned
And start all over

All a big surprise 
You got the warning
It's sooner than I want
But you caught my heart

Me and who you say I was yesterday
Have gone our separate ways
Left my livin' fast somewhere in the past
'Cause that's for chasin' cars
Turns out open bars lead to broken hearts
And goin' way too far
I know I used to be crazy
I know I used to be fun
You say I used to be wild
I say I used to be young
You tell me time has done changed me
That's fine, I've had a good run
I know I used to be crazy
That's 'causе I used to be young
Take onе, pour it out, it's not worth cryin' 'bout
The things you can't erase
Like tattoos and regrets, words I never meant
And ones that got away
Left my livin' fast somewhere in the past
And took another road
Turns out crowded rooms empty out as soon
There's somewhere else to go, oh-oh

I know I used to be fun
You say I used to be wild

Messed up, but, God, was it fun

With your bad attitude 
When you know I'm not one to keep dealin' with the shit

But you stomped it to the ground
And that's what's got me wondering what it's like
To not have you around
If I spent a week without you, hmm
I'd probably have so much fun 
First things first, I'd gather up all my girls, yeah 
So we can lay out in the sun
Oh, it’d be so nice not to worry, yeah
How I’d love not to stress
I'd go and grab my old blue jeans
I’m sick of wearing this silly dress
I know that I gave you my heart
But you stomped it to the ground
And that's what's got me wondering what it's like
To not have you around
You know I’d miss you, babe
Feels like I've known you since I was just 7 years old
You used to make me smile, but now you don't do that anymore
It feels like I'm always just crying and sleeping alone

I’ve seen love go by my door
It’s never been this close before
Never been so easy or so slow
Shooting in the dark too long
When something’s not right, it’s wrong
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go
Dragon clouds so high above
I've only known careless love
It's always hit me from below
But this time around it is more correct
Right on target, so direct
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go
Purple clover, Queen Anne's lace
Crimson hair across your face
You could make me cry, if you don't know
Can't remember what I was thinking of
You might be spoiling me with too much love
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go
Flowers on the hillside blooming crazy
Crickets talking back and forth in rhyme
Blue river running slow and lazy
I could stay with you forever and never realize the time
Situations have ended sad
Relationships have all been bad
Mine have been like Verlaine's and Rimbaud
But there's no way I can compare
All those scenes to this affair
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm doing
Staying far behind without you
You're gonna make me wonder what I'm saying
Make me give myself a good talking-to
I'll look for you in old Honolulu
You're gonna have to leave me now, I know
I'll see you in the sky above
In the tall grass, in the ones I love
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go
Oh, you're gonna make me lonesome when you go
You're gonna make me lonesome when you go

But you see, it's not me, it’s not my family
In your head, in your head, they are cryin'
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are cryin'
In your head, in your head
What’s in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh
Heart is takin' over
When thе violence causes silence
We must be mistaken
It's the same old theme, since 1916
In your head, in your head, they're still fightin'
With their tanks and their bombs and their bombs and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are dyin'
In your head, in your head
What’s in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie-ie, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, eh-eh-aah, ra-ra

Look at what you did
Listen to your friends
When they said niggas ain't shit, 'cause
Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent
Look at what you did
Listen to your friends
When they said niggas ain't shit, 'cause
Umm, you could say that again
Niggas is square like Madison
I can't even really get mad at them
They fall, then I gotta facepalm
Shook him like an 8-ball and it's embarrassin'
Ten-page text, shoulda wrote a book, coulda made a bag
But he broke and he still waitin' 'til I can chill
And he really think I'ma get back to him
Doin' too much, relax a bit
Actin' like that 'cause your dad's a bitch
Must be the way that the planets is
Must be your face 'cause it's not your dick
I'm a freak, not a masochist
Shoulda known you had the baddest bitch
Left on read and can't give head
Really, you ain't shit, need a laxative
Niggas ain't shit, come up in your crib
All up in your fridge, can't pay rent

Said that's not cheatin' if I wasn't with your ass, yo 
You kept secrets and your cousin told me that, so 
Logical thinkin' is just somethin' that you lack, so
What you even mad for?
Lookin' like a stick up in your asshole 
I'm not your mommy, nigga,  find a new hobby, nigga
Return your fob get picked up, your shit's in the lobby, nigga 
I'm not gon' key your car, or call your fuckin' mom 
You should have paid my rent,  go get a fuckin' job

>>>Attention Doja Cat

Baby, if you like it, just reach out and pet it
This one doesn't bite, it doesn't get aggressive
Show you how to touch it, hold it like it's precious
It don't need your lovin', it just needs attention
 It needs, it seeks affection
 Hungry, it fiends attention
 It needs, it seeks affection
Look at me, look at me, you lookin'?
My taste good, but I just had to redirect my cookin'
I coulda been an opener, I redirect the bookin'
I readed all the comments sayin', "D, I'm really shooketh"
"D, you need to see a therapist, is you lookin'?"
Yes, the one I got, they really are the best
Now I feel like I can see you bitches is depressed
I am not afraid to finally say shit with my chest
Lost a lil' weight, but I ain't never lost a tushy
Lookin' good, but now my bald head match my
Lookin' good, but now they all sayin' that I'm ugly
Boo-hoo, my nigga, I ain't sad you won't fuck me
I'm sad that you really thought your ass was above me
You're lucky 'cause I just paid your bill with a reply
I just made your money pile knee-high
I just made your stats peak, now you got a blue check
Now you can afford to go and reinstall a new wig
Now you can afford to not be lousy, go and do shit
Talk your shit about me, I can easily disprove it, it's stupid
You follow me, but you don't really care about the music
Baby, if you like it, just reach out and pet it
This one doesn't bite, it doesn't get aggressive
Show you how to touch it, hold it like it's precious
It don't need your lovin', it just needs attention
 It needs, it seeks affection
 Hungry, it fiends attention
 It needs, it seeks affection
Look at me, look at me, I'm naked
Vulnerability earned me a lot of bacon
I put a thong all in my ass and taught you how to shake it
I paid all my respect to those who taught me how to make it
And now I reap the benefits with no confrontation
Y'all fall into beef, but that's another conversation
I'm sorry, but we all find it really entertainin'
'Cause we all wanna see them slip and fall right on their faces
And we all wanna be the one to see the devastation
Not be in it, but ain't the bad press good?
The disrespect's real, how this Patek look?
Pull out the checkbook, now why yo' neck crook?
I never learn to "superstar" from a textbook
Talkin' 'bout, "She fallin' off, why she get booked?"
Man, I been humble, I'm tired of all the deprecation
Just let me flex, bruh, just let me pop shit
"Why she think she Nicki M? She think she hot shit"
Huh, I never gave a F, go stir the pot, bitch
I got y'all head all in the dirt just like an ostrich
Of course you bitches comparin' Doja to who the hottest
Baby, if you like it, just reach out and pet it
This one doesn't bite, it doesn't get aggressive
Show you how to touch it, hold it like it's precious
It don't need your lovin', it just needs attention
 It needs, it seeks affection
 Hungry, it fiends attention
 It needs, it seeks affection
 Hungry, it fiends

You gon' need to tell my brothers where you from
And I admit it, I still got empathy
And you gon' feel it for two weeks when I release you in them sheets 
And keep my meanin' discreet, keep the cleanin' my gym
Then put that Yeezy in your teeth, let my demons off they leashes
If you even think to speak, I'ma give a whole new meanin'
When you said you live in a dream, we can keep that **** asleep
And you gon' laugh with all your Gs
Countin' them sheep, sheep, sheep, sheep
Talkin' 'bout Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z, R.I.P
You ain't nothin' but a
Dog, player, ah, get it
Fraud, player, ah, get it
I understand, I understand
You ain't the man, you ain't a man
You ain't nothin' but a
Hound dog, hound dog, hound dog

And it's just nerves, it's just dick
Makin' me think 'bout someone new
You know I got so much to say
I try to hide it in my face
And it don't work, you see through
That I just wanna get with you
Can't help it, I want you
Said you right, I
Can't help it, I want you
I can't stop and look the other way
'Cause I know what could be, babe
And you never feel the same
You'd be thinkin' 'bout it every day
Don't believe in fairytales
But we got our fantasies
And it's me and you, no she
Tryna be all through your sheets
Have you all on top of me
Actin' like it's not that deep
Oh, you could take it out on me
Tell me what it's 'bout to be
Really feel it's bound to bе
I can't tell no one, but they all know
I got a man, but I want you
And it's just nеrves, it's just dick
Makin' me think 'bout someone new
You know I got so much to say
I try to hide it in my face
And it don't work, you see through
That I just wanna get with you
You right, I 
Got my guy 
Can't help it, I want you
Said you right, I 
Got my guy 
Can't help it, I want you
Girl, I want you like you want me too
I feel that energy 
When you're on top of me 
I know your man, he ain't controllin' you
But you still hesitate 
'Cause you choose loyalty 
And I know your history 
Met him before your peak 
He's so connected to that woman that you used to be
But-but-but this sex will cloud your memory
A couple strokes to put it in, then you'll belong to me
I got a man, but I want you
I got a man, but I want you 
And it's just nerves, it's just dick
Makin' me think 'bout someone new
You know I got so much to say
I try to hide it in my face

>>>1 Train Kendrick Lamar
<sos>
Uh, feelin' like a vigilante or a missionary
Tell my A$AP killers, get they pistols ready
Send 'em to the cemetery with obituaries
Don't be scared, nigga, is you ready?
I've been thinkin' 'bout all the O's in my bank account 
X the hoes in my bed is 'round the same amount 
Ever since this new star fame came about
Or ever since me and Drizzy started hangin' out, huh
Young boy, let his gun bang, let his nuts hang
Transition to a Lamborghini from a Mustang
Drugs slang in the drug game with the hustling
 Anything is better than that 1 Train
Bag made of Goyard, cheffin' like I'm Boyar—
Dee, probably sellin' D in your local courtyard
Braids like I'm O-Dog, my la familia go hard
Down to my inlaws, they outlaws with no laws
We outlawed, then I bogart, any pros that got 'proached at
With a toe-tag, get broke off in the projects with a skateboard
I roll past and I blaze y'all like, "Doo, doo," I hate y'all
When the beef cooked, I ate y'all like, "Mmm, mmm!"
Let's play ball in a ballpark with all sharks and a blindfold
I rhyme cold, my K hot, your 9 cold, that bark like K9s on
That banana clip, straight from the rip
I'll make that shirt say R.I.P., I'm on some shit
If I'm not the hottest then Hell must have froze over
You thought it was safe then forgot what the code was
I carry traits of a traumatized soldier
Don't look in my face, I might snap, I might choke ya
Spine right out of place, give me dap like you 'posed to
Darts at your posters, dark nights like this
I metamorph like I'm 'posed to, I might slice my wrist
Or pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff
Barely even conscious, talkin' to my conscience
Gettin' deeper in these flows like conches
I'm on my convict, don't drop bars, I drop prisons
Don't sell rocks, seen the spectrum through the prisms
Somehow bypassed the bias and the -isms
The violence and the killin', so given
They seen my pigment and thought that was the ign'ance
Unfortunately, I am not that type of niglet
But pass the pot, let me skillet
Just got back to the block from a 6 o'clock with Jigga
And I'm thinkin' 'bout signin' to the Roc
But my niggas on the block still assigned to the rocks
And I swear it hurt me soul
I try to prevail but when I preach I only hurt their sales
Like you're only gon' end up either dead or in jail
But you my nigga, wish you the best for real
When you mention my name amongst other white rappers
Or for that matter any fuckin' rapper, fuck it
Painter, skater, musician, trailer park, dirt-ditch-diggin'
Burger-flippin', eat, sleep, shittin' human bein', you would be in
Trouble to body-double or couple me to these others
'Cause comparatively speakin', my reach is beyond the bubble
That they put me in, my vision's beyond the Hubble's
I huddle with Nubians, new beginnin' again
You in school at 10, late, Radioactive's goin' gold
And so? Great! Do I give a flying duck
If I'm applyin' love to my rhymin' plus alignin' us?
Alabama's climbin' up—wait! No, I don't give a
Flying duck nothin' but a buckshot; ch-pow!
Motherfuck your life, pussy blood-clot
Ain't never been no rapper this cold since 2Pac was froze
And thawed out for a spot date at a Coachella show—Yelawolf
Weed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties
And my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries
Antsy 'cause I'm high like Michael Jackson, penny loafers
Moonwalkin' on the sun, barefoot, with shades on
Bitch pussy smell like a penguin
Wouldn't hit that shit with my worst enemy's penis
Bitch, when I say this, I mean this
Ho, I'm the meanest
Dick so big, it's like from Earth to Venus
That molly got me nauseous, aw, shit, no off switch
Lawless, obnoxious, on that "suck my cock" shit
That is my synopsis, ostrich's posh shit
Hoes on some goth shit, stop it! You not this!
Novice, regardless, heartless and awkward
Cryin' tears of vodka, prima donna at the concert
Adonis smokin' chronic, 'bout to vomit gin and tonic
Just bein' honest, tell me, isn't that ironic?
Swiftly, I shift the Bimmer 860
A heavy smoker, so you know I brought the Blake with me
The moon’s reflection off the lake hit me
You should have stayed with me
Now many Asian bitches lay with me
The face is silky like a tablecloth
My shorty gallop in the mornin' on the beach like a Chilean horse
Red roses dropped from boxes very often
Confetti torchin', drinkin' Henny like I'm Kenny Lofton
Outstandin', I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Gramblin'
You see us scramblin', sellin' Susan Sarandon
The cloud of smoke like the phantom
Damn, this shit tastes like fantastic, uh
You see me comin' through in each state
Just so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake
Cuffed to my wrist, I've got the briefcase
The gavel slam, I'm a free man, try not to eat ham
Spit like my last breath: casket rap, six deep
Eyes closed, the black is back, out come the 'lac with flats
After that, bottles I can't pronounce, like, “How you ask for that?”
Why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch?
All I had was rap, when all they had was wack
All I wanted was love and all they had was dap
Fuck them haters and fuck them hoes, a championship win is
The aftermath, ask LeBron, open palm, slap a bitch
Walk the plank or break a bank, I've been in the business of sinkin' ships
Chokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with
Resuscitations cost the label, I'm taxin' if you want a hit
Clear, fuck your career, bitch, I was born here
Been a killer, '86er nigga, that's my born year
Get the fuck from 'round here, that's just my country ways
Suckin' on your momma's titty, bitchin' while I was choppin' blade
Grippin' grain, fuckin' hoes, candy paint like Everglades
Miss me with that rapper chatter, take that shit up with my bass
I put that on my soul, how could you ever doubt me?
Most rappers hopin' the world end so they won't have to drop another album
B.B. King saw the king in me, so why can't you?
In order to come up close, you'll have to dig up Cash and Elvis, too
Muddy water flow, Dixie rebel past
Fuck your Louis flag, poppin' benji tags on your wifey's ass 
That's out of line, but in livin' color?
I'm more like Miya Bailey on you rap motherfuckers: a true artist

Or do the feeling haunt you? 
I know the feeling haunt you 
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
Tell me what you gon' do to me
Confrontation ain't nothin' new to me
You can bring a bullet, bring a sword, bring a morgue
But you can't bring the truth to me
Fuck you and all your expectations
I don't even want your congratulations
I recognize your false confidence
And calculated promises all in your conversation
I hate people that feel entitled
Look at me crazy 'cause I didn't invite you
You the moral to the story? You endorsin'?
Mothafucka, I don't even like you
Corrupted man's heart with a gift
That's how you find out who you dealin' with
A small percentage who I'm buildin' with
I want the credit if I'm losin' or I'm winnin'
On my momma, that's the realest shit
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for?
Or do the feeling haunt you? 
I know the feeling haunt you 
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
It's getting cold when an ego gets to talkin'
I get involved, like a rebound
No control, no, I'm switched in the way that you're bringin' me down
It's a turn on, you didn't wait from me
Leave me alone, keep away from me
And it sound wrong, get it away from me, yeah
I just cry for no reason
I just pray for no reason
I just think for the life, for the day
For the hours and another like breathin'
I did it all 'cause it feel good
You'd leave it all if it feel bad
Better live your life
We were runnin' out of time
Love, let's talk about love
Is it anything and everything you hoped for? 
Or do the feeling haunt you? 
I know the feeling haunt you 
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer
This may be the night that my dreams might let me know
All the stars are closer

I recognize you're looking at me for the pay cut
But homicide be looking at you from the face down
What MAC-11 even boom with the bass down?
Schemin', and let me tell you 'bout my life
Painkillers only put me in the twilight
Where pretty pussy and Benjamin is the highlight
Now tell my momma I love her, but this what I like, Lord knows
Twenty of 'em in my Chevy, tell 'em all to come and get me
Reaping everything I sow, so my karma coming heavy
No preliminary hearings on my record
I'm a motherfucking gangster in silence for the record, uh
Tell the world I know it's too late
Boys and girls, I think I've gone cray
Drown inside my vices all day
Won't you please believe when I say
We been hurt, been down before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go?"
Nigga, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho'
Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
What you want you, a house⁠? You, a car?
Forty acres and a mule? A piano, a guitar?
Anything, see my name is Lucy, I'm your dog
Motherfucker, you can live at the mall
I can see the evil, I can tell it, I know it's illegal
I don't think about it, I deposit every other zero
Thinking of my partner, put the candy, paint it on the Regal
Digging in my pocket, ain't a profit big enough to feed you
Every day my logic get another dollar just to keep you
In the presence of your chico, ah!
I don't talk about it, be about it, every day I sequel
If I got it then you know you got it, Heaven, I can reach you
Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, Pat Dawg, my dog, that's all
Bick back and Chad, I trap the bag for y'all
I rap, I black on track so rest assured
My rights, my wrongs; I write 'til I'm right with God
We been hurt, been down before
Nigga, when our pride was low
Lookin' at the world like, "Where do we go?"
Nigga, and we hate po-po
Wanna kill us dead in the street fo sho'
Nigga, I'm at the preacher's door
My knees gettin' weak, and my gun might blow
But we gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
We gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Huh? We gon' be alright
Nigga, we gon' be alright
Do you hear me, do you feel me? We gon' be alright
I keep my head up high
I cross my heart and hope to die
Lovin' me is complicated
Too afraid of a lot of changes
I'm alright, and you're a favorite
Dark nights in my prayers
I remembered you was conflicted
Misusing your influence, sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screamin' in the hotel room
I didn't wanna self-destruct
The evils of Lucy was all around me
So I went runnin' for answers

>>>Auntie Diaries Kendrick Lamar
<sos>
Heart plays in ways the mind can't figure out
Heart plays in ways the mind can't—
Heart plays in ways the mind can't figure out
This is how we conceptualize human beings
My auntie is a man now
I think I'm old enough to understand now
Drinking Paul Masson with her hat turned backwards
Motorola pager, off-white Guess jacket
Blue Air Max's, gold chains, and curl kits
'93 Nissan wax job, the earliest
Big social, big personality, vocal
Played the underground verbatim and stayed local
My auntie is a man now
I watch him and his girl hold their hands down
Tip of the avenues under street lights made his
Thinking, "I want me a bad bitch when I get big"
They hug on the corner like California King
Cold hand all up her skirt, cars whistling down the road
See, my auntie is a man now, slight bravado
Scratching the likes from lotto
Hoping that she pull up tomorrow
So I can hang out in the front seat
Six-by-nines keeping the music up under me
My auntie is a man now
Asked my momma why my uncles don't like him that much
And at the parties why they always wanna fight him that much
She said, "Ain't no tellin'
Niggas always been jealous because he had more women
More money and more attention made more envy
Calling him anything but broke was less offending"
My auntie is a man now
I think I'm old enough to understand now
Drinking Paul Masson with her hat turned backwards
Back when it was comedic relief to say, "Faggot"
"Faggot, faggot, faggot," we ain't know no better
Elementary kids with no filter, however
My auntie became a man and I took pride in it
She wasn't gay, she ate pussy, and that was the difference
That's what I told my friends in second grade
She picking me up from school, they stare at her in the face
They couldn't comprehend what I grew accustomed
We pull off bumpin' Quik like it was nothing
My auntie is a man now, what a relationship
I grew up fast, I needed no one to babysit
He gave me some cash then gave me some game
Cherry freshener on the dash, I never complained
She even cut my hair at the pad, was loving my fade
The first person I seen write a rap
That's when my life had changed
House full of demo, smoke stuck on the window
Cameras on the microphone, all women and men know
My auntie was a man now, we cool with it
The history had trickled down and made us ign'ant
My favorite cousin said he's returning the favor
And following my auntie with the same behavior
Demetrius is Mary-Ann now
He's more confident to live his plan now 
But the family in disbelief this time 
Convincing themselves, "He ain't living discreet, he's fine" 
They said they never seen it in him, but I seen it 
The Barbie dolls played off reflection of Venus 
He built a wall so tall you couldn't climb over
He didn't laugh as hard when the kids start joking 
"Faggot, faggot, faggot," we ain't know no better
Middle school kids with no filter, however
I had to be very mindful of my good cousin
I knew exactly who he was, but I still loved him
Demetrius is Mary-Ann now
I mean he's really Mary-Ann, even took things further
Changed his gender before Bruce Jenner was certain
Living his truth even if it meant see a surgeon
We didn't talk for a while, he seemed more distant
Wasn't comfortable around me, everything was offensive
But I recall we both had a sick sense of humor
Made raw, but time changes all
Demetrius is Mary-Ann now
Remember church, Easter Sunday?
I sat in the pew, you had stronger faith
More spiritual when these dudes were living life straight
Which I found ironic 'cause the pastor didn't see him the same
He said my cousin was going through some things
He promised the world we living in was an act on abomination
And Demetrius was to blame
I knew you was conflicted by the feelings of preacherman
Wondering if God still call you a decent man
Still, you found the courage to be subservient just to anoint
Until he singled you out to prove his point, saying
"Demetrius is Mary-Ann now
Church, his auntie is a man now," it hurt
You the most 'cause your belief was close to his words
Forcing me to stand now
I said, "Mr. Preacherman, should we love thy neighbor?
The laws of the land or the heart, what's greater?
I recognize the study she was taught since birth
But that don't justify the feelings that my cousin preserved"
The building was thinking out loud, bad angel
That's when you looked at me and smiled, said, "Thank you"
The day I chose humanity over religion
The family got closer, it was all forgiven
I said them F-bombs, I ain't know any better
Mistakenly, I ain't think that you'd know any different
See, I was taught words was nothing more than a sound
If ever they was pronounced without any intentions
The very second you challenged the shit I was kicking
Reminded me about a show I did out the city
That time I brung a fan on stage to rap
But disapproved the word that she couldn't say with me
You said, "Kendrick, ain't no room for contradiction
To truly understand love, switch position
'Faggot, faggot, faggot,' we can say it together
But only if you let a white girl say 'Nigga'"
<eos>

What'cha know about Radiohead's hit song "Creep"?
When you do that jump, you can feel that natural breeze
He's employee of the month, Sponge has got that devotion
I could use some cucumber melon lotion
Ay, why am I about to fall right the fuck to sleep?
When you make that dough, you can call yourself big cheese
When these people talk too much, give myself a promotion
I feel like brewin' a witch's potion
I'm like, "Nah, that's blue"
I believe in B-O-B
Don't believe in G-L-O-B-E
She keep chewin' her gum
I'mma makе her lip numb
I can't find my pencil
Wherе the fuck is my goddamn pencil?
Got the gout from Saurkraut
I just blew up Tomato Town
Ending lives at the speed of sound
Sean Fay-Wolfe is in your house
Tunnel to the core like Jules G. Verne
Joe was cool, but I like Steve Burns
Mainstream music is so diverse
Big-ass suit like David Byrne 
That new song from Meg just came on
Let's all sip this lemonade for refreshment
People's tastes nowadays are eclectic
Got cucumber melon lotion
Shadow Ball just got reflected, Ay!
Put this shit in a frame
I just made you lose The Game
Yeah, I bet it's been years since you've thought about the game
Gotta get the fame
Chase it 'til I'm dead
Kylie Minogue said: "LA LA LA LA LA"

Wanna piece of crap?
A piece of shit?
A load of shit?
Can you go suck a dick, dumbshit?
Let's all rock out to Powerline
Lost shit in the Grapevine
Everything you just heard was random
But was it really more incoherent than:
What'cha know about rollin' down in the deep?
When your brain goes numb, you can call that "Mental Freeze"
When these people talk too much, put that shit in slow motion
I feel like an astronaut in the ocean
Ay, What'cha know about rollin' down in the deep?

Lord, forgive me, Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away, I got
My drink, I got my music, I would share it, but today I'm yellin'
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Look inside of my soul and you can find gold and maybe get rich
Look inside of your soul and you can find out it never exist
I can feel the changes, I can feel a new life, I always
Knew life can be dangerous, I can say that I like a challenge
And you tell me it's painless, you don't know what pain is
How can I paint this picture when the color blind is hangin' witcha?
Fell on my face and awoke with a scar, another mistake livin' deep in my heart
Wear it on top of my sleeve in a flick, I can admit that it did look like yours
Why you resent every makin' of his? Tell me your purpose is petty again
But even a small lighter can burn a bridge, even a small lighter can burn a bridge
I can feel the changes, I can feel the new people round me
Just wanna be famous, you can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me, that's amazin'
To you, that's a quick check, with all disrespect, let me say this
I am a sinner
Who's prob'ly gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me, Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away, I got
My drink, I got my music, I would share it, but today I'm yellin'
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
I'm tryna keep it alive and not compromise the feelin' we love
You're tryna keep it deprived and only co-sign what radio does
And I'm lookin' right past ya, we live in a world, we live in a world
On two different axles, you live in a world, you livin' behind
The mirror, I know what you're scared of, the feeling of feeling emotions inferior
This shit is vital, I know you had to, this shit is vital, I know you had to
Die in a pitiful vain, tell me a watch and a chain is way more believable
Give me a feasible gain, rather a seasonal name, I'll let the people know
This is somethin' you can blame on yourselves, you can remain stuck in a box
I'ma breakout and then hide every lock, I'ma breakout and then hide every lock
I can feel the changes, I can feel the new people round me
Just wanna be famous, you can see that my city found me
Then put me on stages, to me, that's amazin'
To you, that's a quick check, with all disrespect, let me say this
I am a sinner
Who's prob'ly gonna sin again
Lord, forgive me, Lord, forgive me
Things I don't understand
Sometimes I need to be alone
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
I can feel your energy from two planets away, I got
My drink, I got my music, I would share it, but today I'm yellin'
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, you ain't heard the coast
Like this in a long time, don't you see that long line?
And they waitin' on Kendrick like the 1st and the 15th
Threes in the air, I can see you are in sync
Hide your feelings, hide your feelings, now, what you better do
I'll take your girlfriend then put that pussy on the pedestal
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Walk out the door and they scream, "It's alive!"
My New Year's resolution is to stop all the pollution
Talk too motherfuckin' much, I got my drink, I got my music
I say, bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
Bitch, don't kill my vibe, bitch, don't kill my vibe
"K-Dot, get in the car, nigga!
Come on, we finna roll out!
Nigga, I got a pack of blacks and a beat CD
Get yo' freestyles ready!"
>>>Blood Kendrick Lamar
<sos>
Are we gonna live or die?
So I was takin' a walk the other day
And I seen a woman—a blind woman
Pacin' up and down the sidewalk
She seemed to be a bit frustrated
As if she had dropped somethin' and
Havin' a hard time findin' it
So after watchin' her struggle for a while
I decide to go over and lend a helping hand, you know?
"Hello, ma'am, can I be of any assistance?
It seems to me that you have lost something
I would like to help you find it"
She replied, "Oh, yes, you have lost something
You've lost… your life"
Lamar stated his views on police brutality
With that line in the song, quote
"And we hate the popo, wanna kill us in the street fo' sho'"
Oh, please, ugh, I don't like itSee Kendrick Lamar LiveGet tickets as low as $

Wow. All I'm saying dude, if you're ready - thats all I'm asking, because I'm fucking ready to do this ok. I just need you to count me in, cause I don't know how to get my bars in and I just need to know - let me know when to come in, cause I'm not ready - well - I'm ready, but you're not ready, ready?
I bent up a car with Kendrick Lamar in it
I'm arsenic sent from hell with a large tentacle
You set up the bar high well I set it to Venus
The Incredible Hulk outta' control with a prosthetic penis
I'm ready to brawl machetes and all
Make a medical call tell 'em I cut em and wrapped him in gauze
Left him severed in plenty of jars
I'm a son of a dog I'm authentic
You're all fake you're all printed
Take it from the real I'm consulting it
Your wound I throw salt in it
Shit on your grave after put y'all in it
I ain't messin' around this ain't the 3rd grade
I'mma monster I cause earthquakes
Im an adoption that turned straight
I find you on your birthday, crash a Merce-Des benz through your house blasting tunes in
I call that house music
A roundhouse to your face and leave your mother's mouth oozin'
Amoxicillin to kill my sickness
Its not workin, its maybe tetanus
This may be sicker this may be what doctors never witnessed
You cowards won't never listen so listen I enter with friction and
And break the condom like AW shit I came in this bitch again
Hip-Hop is my bitch get of my bitch she ain't talkin' to you
She's on my balls and dick
Her jaws and lips suckin' like a ballsy tick
Mc's lost me quick when they watch me drip
Venom when I hawk and spit
I'm often layin yall in the coffin shit
I'm awesome when I boss and terrorize and then I off the click
You think I'm awful when ya boys think I'm awfully sick
Next to Tracy like hey baby you can call me dick
Don't you cross me bitch
Hip-Hop just lost a tit
I milked it for what its worth
Yall pussy like Barbies clit
I bomb like army vets when I map shit out like architects
Claim yall freestyle when your bars on text
I'm off beat intentionally so yall can start to bitch
About half of these rappers on the charts swallow dicks
25% should just feed themselves hollow tips
The other 25 are rarely or ever on the list
I kill mics, I drill mics into these hearts of pricks
Man fuck it these puppets are strung up
Me and Hip-Hop in a relationship no strings attached I'll have you fuckers hung up
Man, what? No fuckin' way. Yeah I gotta go now, I got shit to do
<eos>
>>>Dedication Kendrick Lamar
<sos>
Look, my nigga this is dedication, this is anti-hesitation
This a real nigga celebration
This a Dime Blocc declaration
59th and 5th Ave, granny house with vanilla wafers
This the remedy, the separation
2Pac of my generation, blue pill in the fuckin' Matrix
Red rose in the gray pavement
Young black nigga trapped and he can't change it
Know he a genius, he just can't claim it
'Cause they left him no platforms to explain it
He frustrated so he get faded
But deep down inside he know you can't fade him
How long should I stay dedicated?
How long 'til opportunity meet preparation?
I need some real nigga reparations
'Fore I run up in your bank just for recreation
Dedication, hard work plus patience
The sum of all my sacrifice, I'm done waitin'
I'm done waitin', told you that I wasn't playin'
Now you hear what I been sayin'
I spent my whole life thinkin' out the box
Boxin' homies three-on-one, got DP'ed but I ain't drop
Chirp on me, here I come, brrt, spin around the block
They blurped on me, said I ran a stop sign but that's a lie
I spent my whole life starin' at the stage
Playin' Sega, daddy smokin' sherm, mama playin' spades
Catchin' vapors, grandma said I'd get some Jordans for my grades
That's my baby, when she died my heart broke a hundred ways
I spent my whole life tryna make it, tryna chase it
The cycle of a black man divided, tryna break it
You take a loss? Shit, don't cry about it, just embrace it
Minor setback for major comeback, that's my favorite
My nigga L said, "You do a song with Nip, K. Dot, he a better Crip"
I said, "He a man first, you hear the words out his lips
About flourishing from the streets to black businesses?"
Level four, yard livin', given to false imprisonment
Listen close, my nigga
It's bigger than deuces and fours, my nigga
Since elementary we close, my nigga, yeah, straight like that
I give you the game, go back to the turf and give it right back
For generations we been dealt bad hands with bad plans
Prove your dedication by hoppin' out Grand Am's
I'm at the premiere politickin' with Top, Nip, and Snoop
Damn, Pac watchin' the way we grew, from dedication
If it ain't congratulate then it look like hate
If it ain't congratulate then it look like what, Nipsey?
This ain't entertainment, it's for niggas on the slave ship
These songs just the spirituals I swam against them waves with
Ended up on shore to they amazement
Now I hope the example I set's not contagious
Lock us behind gates but can't tame us
Used to be, "Stay safe," now it's, "Stay dangerous"
'Cause ain't no point in playin' defense, nigga
That's why I dove off the deep end, nigga, without a life jacket
Couple mil', tour the world, dawg, my life crackin'
Cook the books, bring it back so it's no taxes
Royalties, publishing, plus I own masters
I'll be damned if I slave for some white crackers
I was mappin' this out, I hit the heist backwards
Hoppin' out the eighty-five in Reebok Classics
Ran a couple marathons just to get established
To make it happen, you got to have it
Dedication, hard work plus patience
The sum of all my sacrifice, I'm done waitin'
I'm done waitin', told you that I wasn't playin'
Now you hear what I been sayin'

Now you hear what I been sayin'
I pop the pain away, I slide the pain away
I picked you up when you
Fell and cut your knee
Told you not to cry and held you
I hope I'm not too late
To set my demons straight
I know I made you wait
But how much can you take?
I hope you see the God in me
I hope you can see
And if it's up, stay down for me
Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa puff
Serafina, flame in us
Where I'd be without your love
Rest your wings and trust, I feel you
Deep, I feel, deep, I feel 
Deep, I feel, deep, too 
Deep, I feel, deep, I feel 
Deep, I feel, deep, you 
Do you love me? Do you trust me?
Can I trust you? Don't judge me
I'ma die hard, it gets ugly
Too passionate, it gets ugly
I wonder where I lost my way?
Been waiting on your call all day
Tell me you in my corner right now
When I fall short, I'm leanin' on you to cry out
We all got enough to lie about
My truth too complicated to hide now
Can I open up? Is it safe or not?
I'm afraid a little, you relate or not?
Have faith a little, I might take my time
Ain't no savin' face this time
I hope I'm not too late
To set my demons straight
I know I made you wait
But how much can you take?
I hope you see the God in me
I hope you can see
And if it's up, stay down for me
Shimmy, shimmy, cocoa puff

Where I'd be without your love
Rest your wings and trust, I feel you
Deep, I feel, deep, I feel 
Deep, I feel, deep, too 
Deep, I feel, deep, I feel 
Deep, I feel, deep, you 
I got some regrets
But my past won't keep me from my best
Subtle mistakes felt like life or death
I wanna see the family stronger
I wanna see the money longer
You know that I'd die for you
I get emotional about life
The lost ones keepin' me up at night
The world be reminding me it's danger
I'll still risk it all for a stranger
If I told you who I am, would you use it against me?
Right or wrong, no stone, just love to send me
I hope I'm not too late
To set my demons straight
I know I made you wait
But how much can you take?
I hope you see the God in me
I hope you can see
And if it's up, stay down for me
Baby, you make me
'Cause if I won it all without you involved
I guess it's all for nothing

This shit is fresh out the oven
Fresh out the oven
I'm back in this bitch, nigga you know what's up
Straight out that gutta so you know just what you dealin' with
But that's way before the liquor hits
Roll that kushy kushy, rub on her goodie goodies
Crush her so good, she all on my timeline now
Lookin', lookin', she tryna sabatoge my thing
Never go brazy when you're deep inside the pink
I'm lowkey like a drug dealer
So don't snitch, my nigga, get your chips, my nigga
Mind your business, I minds mine, let's get rich, my nigga
Take our family on trips, my nigga
But if you try me then your wig I'ma split, my nigga
And I ain't tryna kill my own kind
But we always losin' to the wrong place at the wrong time, no lie
And they wonder why us niggas always get high
Spend a thou-wow on it just to get fly
Another thou-wow on it just to get by
Fuck it, only got one life to live
Gotta push it to the limit, do it big like
What? This shit is fresh out the oven
Whip game cold, man this shit 'bout to bubble
Big bank rolls, either hate it or love it
It's anything goes, just as long as you thuggin'
Just as long as you thuggin', yeah it's fresh out the oven
Whip game cold, man this shit 'bout to bubble
Big bank rolls, either hate it or love it
It's anything goes, just as long as you thuggin'
Just as long as you thuggin'
Big bank rolls, just as long as you thuggin'
Whip game cold, just as long as you thuggin'
I pull up and park, hop out and swag
Grab the Glock out the trunk, other Glock in the stash
Just a regular nigga, with no chains or nothin'
If I do get some shines, you try to snatch
There's repercussions, and concussions
You know what's after that, end of discussions
I came a long way from eatin' free lunches
From Mary County checks to makin' these numbers
Oh Lord, I'm just reminiscin'
Could it be some intervention on some inner vision?
I don't know, 'cause I'm just goin' with the flow
Whatever's required, I got it goin' for the low
Ah, I parted ways with my old self, I'm a new man
New face with a new stone and the blue van
Blew weight on a bad day with my loosie
Suitcase full of merchandise, that's my new plan
This my new wave, this my new tan
This my summer days in the tropics by the cool sand
This my shakin' down you niggas' pockets, I don't do friends
And I don't do trends
Fuck it though I'll ride with you then!
Bring the troops in
I'll fuck around and let 'em loose then
We'll give 'em blues then
Oh fuck it, call me Bobby "Blue" Bland
Aye you a fool man
Ridin' by you, swervin' at the intersection
Baby come and get your blessin'
And she gon' fuck with this erection
I got somethin' good for all these hoes
She gotta want the Betty 'fore I call these hoes
Now if I paid for your dress and your perm
That means you an investment, bitch
I'ma need my dough in return
We reporting live from the 9 double 0-5-9 with my nigga Jay Rock and this is WTOP Radio and I'm your host DJ Turn-Up
I don't turn down nuttin' but my collar
I ain't turnin' down no money
And I ain't turnin' down no mothafuckin' fade
Now bitch if you're pushin' up the freak with your orangutan-lookin' ass, take some advice and bang SZA ya flat-foot bitch
Itchin' for a climax lasting past 11:30
Do you got it like that, do you really got it like that?
Itchin' for a purpose, I can't seem to scratch the surface
I ain't got it like that, do I really got it like that?
You keep talkin' 'bout time, I got none
You can find me where
The sun don't never end and the waves don't part
You don't pay enough of my rent, don't start
I got big dreams and you got quick scheme to get rich quickly
And I don't wanna waste another hour
Really need to take another shower
Now this that big shell fishscale
BMX on the ramp with the fishtail
Pegs on the front, we gon' get there
We 4 deep at a swapmeet, don't need a 5th wheel
This bitch steal whoever if situations get real
This that fresh out the bounty, bustin' knuckles
Get buckled if you ever try to knock the hustle
Show your hands, watch how I shuffle 
And show you why they hate more niggas than Uncle Ruckus
Rollin' up that boondock, some call it moon rock
Gotta keep that bass in my step, dope in a tube sock
Gotta do what I do to remain on
So all a nigga need is good love when I come home
Cause the baby's gotta eat, baby the rent's been due lately
And I just caught a hot one, I ain't tryna go too brazy
Fugazi, not me, me and my niggas not sweet
Give you thug passion, how you walkin' around knock-kneed
I'm the silver bullet movin' at top speed
Show you how to get it and get away with it scott free

Put down your IG and look through my lens
A million to grandma, who did I offend?
The girl of your dreams to me is a fan
I netted ten million and did a lil' dance
I'm fuckin' the world, I unzip my pants
My uncle G told me that I had a chance
So then I popped out and did it again
And did it again and did it again
I can not respect them, where did he begin?
Advice from the council, let nobody in
Been swervin' through rumors
Avoidin' the trends and duckin' the hoes
I'm duckin' the loonies that come with the shows
I'm grateful to Man-Man, he opened up doors
A bunk on the tour bus to come and compose
I reach to the stars on my tippy toes
This greatest success where most niggas fold
I tell you my past, that shit don't get old
But how could you ask like I don't be writin' my raps?
These critics got everyone tapped
You gotta relax, the city where nobody sleep
Just tap in and ask where I'm at, ho
Smokin' on your top five tonight, tonight
Yeah, I'm smokin' on your, what's his name, tonight, tonight
Smokin' on you, shores, ain't two-nine, yeah, two
I am the omega, pgLang, Rollie gang, SIE
Don't you address me unless it's with four letters
I thought you'd known better
I been duckin' the pandemic, I been—, social gimmicks
I been duckin' the overnight activists, yeah
I'm not a trending topic, I'm a—
Hold on, y'all niggas playin' with me, man
I am the omega, pgLang, Rollie gang, SIE
Don't you address me unless it's with four letters
Bitch, I thought you'd known better
I been duckin' the pandemic, I been duckin' the social gimmicks
I been duckin' the overnight activists, yeah
I'm not a trending topic, I'm a prophet
I answer to Metatron and Gabriel
Bitch, looking for a better me
I am a legacy, I come from the seventy
The Al Green offspring, guns and the melody
The big shot, wrist on cryotherapy
Soon as I press that button
Nigga better get right like the ambulance comin'
Us two ain't alike, he ain't been through nothin'
Dave Free got at least one B in the oven
I'm trippin', I'm juugin', my mental is amazing, brother
Pop off, only on occasions, brother
Rich nigga, momma know I made it, brother
Go figure, never caught cases, brother
Face it, brother, gracious brother
New flows comin', be patient, brother
Show my ass and take y'all to class
I can multitask like Megan, brother
2021, I ain't takin' no prisoner
Last year, y'all fucked up all the listener
Who went platinum? I call that a visitor
Who the fuck backin' 'em? All been falsified
The facts mean this a vaccine and the game need me to survive
The Elohim, the rebirth
Before you get to the Father, you gotta holla at me first, bitch
Smokin' on top fives
Motherfuck that album, fuck that single
Burn that hard drive 
When I come, I'm killin' everybody that's outside 
Yeah, Kanye changed his life
But me, I'm still an old-school Gemini 
Let me jump in this bitch
Two phones, but I only bring one in this bitch
One daughter, but they all my sons in this bitch
No hoes, ain't shit gettin' done in this bitch
I'm scary, I got a gun in this bitch
Smokin' on top fives
Stop playin', I'm that guy
Number two DM'ing my bitch
That's cool, I don't ask why

I don’t think I could find a way to make it on this earth
Yeah, it’s your cousin Carl, man, just givin' you a call, man
I know you been havin' a lot on yo' mind lately
And I know you feel like, you know
People ain't been prayin' for you
But you have to understand this, man, that we are a cursed people Deuteronomy 28:28 says, "The Lord shall smite thee with madness And blindness, and astonishment of heart"
See, family, that's why you feel like you feel
Like you got a chip on your shoulder
Until you follow His commandments, you gonna feel that way...
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?
Pain in my heart carry burdens full of struggle
Why God, why God do I gotta bleed?
Every stone thrown at you restin' at my feet
Why God, why God do I gotta suffer?

I beat yo’ ass, keep talkin' back
I beat yo' ass, who bought you that?
You stole it, I beat yo' ass if you say that game is broken
I beat yo' ass if you jump on my couch
I beat yo' ass if you walk in this house
With tears in your eyes, runnin' from Poo Poo and Prentice
Go back outside, I beat yo' ass, lil' nigga
That homework better be finished, I beat yo' ass
Your teachers better not be bitchin' 'bout you in class
That pizza better not be wasted, you eat it all
That TV better not be loud if you got it on
Them Jordans better not get dirty when I just bought 'em
Better not hear 'bout you humpin' on Keisha's daughter
Better not hear you got caught up
I beat yo' ass, you better not run to your father
I beat yo' ass, you know my patience runnin' thin
I got buku payments to make
County building's on my ass, tryna take my food stamps away
I beat yo' ass if you tell them social workers he live here
I beat yo' ass if I beat yo' ass twice and you still here
Seven years old, think you run this house by yourself?
Nigga, you gon' fear me if you don't fear no one else
If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucker up
And then I'd take two puffs
I'm high now , I'm high now 
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
I don't think I could find a way to make it on this earth
I'll prolly die anonymous, I'll prolly die with promises
I'll prolly die walkin' back home from the candy house
I'll prolly die because these colors are standin' out
I'll prolly die because I ain't know Demarcus was snitchin'
I'll prolly die at these house parties, fuckin' with bitches
I'll prolly die from witnesses leavin' me falsed accused
I'll prolly die from thinkin' that me and your hood was cool
Or maybe die from pressin' the line, actin' too extra
Or maybe die because these smokers are more than desperate
I'll prolly die from one of these bats and blue badges
Body-slammed on black and white paint, my bones snappin'
Or maybe die from panic or die from bein' too lax
Or die from waitin' on it, die 'cause I'm movin' too fast
I'll prolly die tryna buy weed at the apartments
I'll prolly die tryna defuse two homies arguin'
I'll prolly die 'cause that's what you do when you're 17
All worries in a hurry, I wish I controlled things
If I could smoke fear away, I'd roll that mothafucker up
And then I'd take two puffs
I'm high now , I'm high now 
Life's a bitch, pull them panties to the side now
When I was 27, I grew accustomed to more fear
Accumulated 10 times over throughout the years
My newfound life made all of me magnified
How many accolades do I need to block denial?
The shock value of my success put bolts in me
All this money, is God playin' a joke on me?
Is it for the moment, and will he see me as Job?
Take it from me and leave me worse than I was before?
At 27, my biggest fear was losin' it all
Scared to spend money, had me sleepin' from hall to hall
Scared to go back to Section 8 with my mama stressin'
30 shows a month and I still won't buy me no Lexus
What is an advisor? Somebody that's holdin' my checks
Just to fuck me over and put my finances in debt?
I read a case about Rihanna's accountant and wondered
How did the Bad Girl feel when she looked at them numbers?
The type of shit'll make me flip out and just kill somethin'
Drill somethin', get ill and fill ratchets with a lil' somethin'
I practiced runnin' from fear, guess I had some good luck
At 27 years old, my biggest fear was bein' judged
How they look at me reflect on myself, my family, my city
What they say 'bout me reveal if my reputation would miss me
What they see from me would trickle down generations in time
What they hear from me would make 'em highlight my simplest lines
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' creativity
I'm talkin' fear, fear of missin' out on you and me
I'm talkin' fear, fear of losin' loyalty from pride
'Cause my DNA won't let me involve in the light of God
I'm talkin' fear, fear that my humbleness is gone
I'm talkin' fear, fear that love ain't livin' here no more
I'm talkin' fear, fear that it's wickedness or weakness
Fear, whatever it is, both is distinctive
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully, they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Searchin' for resolutions until somebody get back
Fear, what happens on Earth stays on Earth
And I can't take these feelings with me, so hopefully they disperse
Within fourteen tracks, carried out over wax
Wonderin' if I'm livin' through fear or livin' through rap
God damn you, God damn me
God damn us, God damn we
God damn us all
Verse 2 says, "You only have I known of all the families of the Earth, therefore I will punish you for all your iniquities"
So until we come back to these commandments
Until you come back to these commandments
We gonna feel this way, we gonna be under this curse
Because He said He's gonna punish us
The so-called Blacks, Hispanics, and Native American Indians
Are the true children of Israel
We are the Israelites, according to the Bible
The children of Israel
He's gonna punish us for our iniquities, for our disobedience
Because we chose to follow other gods
That man chastens his son, so the Lord, thy God, chasten thee
So, just like you chasten your own son, He's gonna chasten you
Because He loves you, so that's why we get chastised
That's why we're in the position that we're in
Until we come back to these laws, statutes, and commandments
And do what the Lord says, these curses is gonna be upon us
We gonna be at a lower state in this life that we live
Here, in today, in the United States of America

I feel like my thoughts in the basement
Feel like, I feel like you're miseducated
Feel like I don't wanna be bothered
I feel like you may be the problem
I feel like it ain't no tomorrow, fuck the world
The world is endin', I'm done pretendin'
And fuck you if you get offended
I feel like friends been overrated
I feel like the family been fakin'
I feel like the feelings are changin'
Feel like my thought of compromise is jaded
Feel like you wanna scrutinize how I made it
Feel like I ain't feelin' you all
Feel like removin' myself, no feelings involved
I feel for you, I've been in the field for you
It's real for you, right? Shit, I feel like—
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
I feel niggas been out of pocket
I feel niggas tappin' they pockets
I feel like debatin' on who the greatest can stop it
I am legend, I feel like all of y'all is peasants
I feel like all of y'all is desperate
I feel like all it take is a second to feel like
Mike Jordan whenever holdin' a real mic
I ain't feelin' your presence
Feel like I'ma learn you a lesson
Feel like only me and the music though
I feel like your feelin' ain't mutual
I feel like the enemy you should know
Feel like the feelin' of no hope
The feelin' of bad dope
A quarter ounce manipulated from soap
The feelin', the feelin' of false freedom
I'll force-feed 'em the poison that fill 'em up in the prison
I feel like it's just me
Look, I feel like I can't breathe
Look, I feel like I can't sleep
Look, I feel heartless, often off this
Feelin' of fallin', of fallin' apart with
Darkest hours, lost it
Fillin' the void of bein' employed with ballin'
Streets is talkin', fill in the blanks with coffins
Fill up the banks with dollars
Fill up the graves with fathers
Fill up the babies with bullshit
Internet blogs and pulpit, fill 'em with gossip
I feel like this gotta be the feelin' where 'Pac was
The feelin' of an apocalypse happenin'
But nothin' is awkward, the feelin' won't prosper
The feelin' is toxic, I feel like I'm boxin' demons
Monsters, false prophets schemin'
Niggas, bitches, honkies, crackers, Compton
Church, religion, token blacks in bondage
Lawsuit visits, subpoena served in concert
Fuck your feelings, I mean this for imposters
I can feel it, the phoenix sure to watch us
I can feel it, the dream is more than process
I can put a regime that forms a Loch Ness
I can feel it, the scream that haunts all logic
I feel like sayin' somethin', I feel like takin' somethin'
I feel like skatin' off, I feel like waitin' for 'em
Maybe it's too late for 'em
I feel like the whole world want me to pray for 'em
But who the fuck prayin' for me?
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Who prayin' for me?

I feel for you, I've been in the field for you
It's real for you, right? Shit, I feel like—
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
I feel niggas been out of pocket
I feel niggas tappin' they pockets
I feel like debatin' on who the greatest can stop it
I am legend, I feel like all of y'all is peasants
I feel like all of y'all is desperate
I feel like all it take is a second to feel like
Mike Jordan whenever holdin' a real mic
I ain't feelin' your presence
Feel like I'ma learn you a lesson
Feel like only me and the music though
I feel like your feelin' ain't mutual
I feel like the enemy you should know
Feel like the feelin' of no hope
The feelin' of bad dope
A quarter ounce manipulated from soap
The feelin', the feelin' of false freedom
I'll force-feed 'em the poison that fill 'em up in the prison
I feel like it's just me
Look, I feel like I can't breathe
Look, I feel like I can't sleep
Look, I feel heartless, often off this
Feelin' of fallin', of fallin' apart with
Darkest hours, lost it
Fillin' the void of bein' employed with ballin'
Streets is talkin', fill in the blanks with coffins
Fill up the banks with dollars
Fill up the graves with fathers
Fill up the babies with bullshit
Internet blogs and pulpit, fill 'em with gossip
I feel like this gotta be the feelin' where 'Pac was
The feelin' of an apocalypse happenin'
But nothin' is awkward, the feelin' won't prosper
The feelin' is toxic, I feel like I'm boxin' demons
Monsters, false prophets schemin'
Niggas, bitches, honkies, crackers, Compton
Church, religion, token blacks in bondage
Lawsuit visits, subpoena served in concert
Fuck your feelings, I mean this for imposters
I can feel it, the phoenix sure to watch us
I can feel it, the dream is more than process
I can put a regime that forms a Loch Ness
I can feel it, the scream that haunts all logic
I feel like sayin' somethin', I feel like takin' somethin'
I feel like skatin' off, I feel like waitin' for 'em
Maybe it's too late for 'em
I feel like the whole world want me to pray for 'em
But who the fuck prayin' for me?
Ain't nobody prayin' for me
Who prayin' for me?
Fuck you, motherfucker, you a ho-ass nigga
I don't know why you trying to go big, nigga, you ain't shit
Walking around like you God's gift to Earth, nigga, you ain't shit
You ain't even buy me no outfit for the Fourth
I need that Brazilian, wavy, twenty-eight inch, you playin'
I shouldn't be fuckin' with you anyway
I need a baller-ass, boss-ass nigga
You's a off-brand-ass nigga, everybody know it
Your homies know it, everybody fuckin' know
Fuck you, nigga, don't call me no more
You won't know, you gonna lose on a good bitch
My other nigga is on, you off
What the fuck is really going on?
This dick ain't free
You lookin' at me like it ain't a receipt
Like I never made ends meet
Eating your leftovers and raw meat
This dick ain't free
Livin' in captivity raised my cap salary
Celery, tellin' me green is all I need
Evidently, all I seen was Spam and raw sardines
This dick ain't free, I mean, baby
You really think we could make a baby named Mercedes
Without a Mercedes Benz and twenty-four-inch rims
Five percent tint, and air conditioning vents?
Hell fuckin' naw, this dick ain't free
I need forty acres and a mule
Not a forty ounce and a pitbull
Had the door knockin', let 'em in, who's that?
Genital's best friend, this dick ain't free
Pity the fool that made the pretty in you prosper
Titty juice and pussy lips kept me obnoxious
Kept me up watchin' pornos in poverty; apology? No
Watch you politic with people less fortunate, like myself
Every dog has its day, now doggy style shall help
This dick ain't free
Matter of fact, it need interest
Matter of fact, it's nine inches
Matter of fact, see our friendship based on business
Pension, more pension, you're pinchin' my percents
It's been relentless, fuck forgiveness, fuck your feelings
Fuck your sources, all distortion, if you fuck it's more abortion
More divorce courts and portion
My check with less endorsement left me dormant
Dusted, doomed, disgusted, forced with
Fuck you think is in more shit?
Porcelain pipes pressure, bust 'em twice
Choice is devastated, decapitated the horseman
Oh America, you bad bitch, I picked cotton and made you rich
Now my dick ain't free
I'ma get my Uncle Sam to fuck you up
You ain't no king
<eos>
>>>Forbidden Fruit Kendrick Lamar
<sos>
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip 
Apple juice falling from her lips, took a little sip
Lil' sip, took a lil' sip
Took a lil' sip, t-took a lil', took a lil', took a lil' sip
Ayo, I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
Where niggas hold tech's like they mad at the ref
That's why I keep a cross on my chest, either that or a vest
Do you believe that Eve had Adam in check
And if so, you gotta expect
To sip juice from the forbidden fruit and get loose
Cole is the king, most definite
My little black book thicker than the Old Testament
Niggas pay for head but the pussy sold separate
Same bitch giving brains to the minister
The same reason they call Mr. Cee the finisher
Forbidden fruit, watch for the Adam's apple
Slick with words don't hate me, son
What you eat don't make me shit and who you fuck don't make me cum
Put a price on my head won't make me run
Try to kill me but it can't be done
'Cause my words gon' live forever
You put two and two together Cole here forever
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip 
Apple juice falling from her lips, took a little sip
Bitches come and go 
Money come and go 
Love come and go 
Bitches come and go 
Money come and go 
Love come and go 
Take a seat baby girl you've been all in my mind
I know I ain't called gotta pardon my grind
Just copped a maroon 5, no Adam Levine
'Came a man by myself, only father was time
I know that she relate baby daddy ain't shit
So she raised that nigga kids but she swallowing mine
And that's why you all on my mind
All on my line like caller number nine
'Cause a nigga poppin' like Harlem in the nine-seven
Way before Mase was a reverend
I was a young nigga making A's at 11
Or 12, trying to get a taste of the Heaven
Or Hell, only time gon' tell
Fuck her while her mama home, "baby, don't yell"
How many records do a nigga gotta sell
Just to get the cover of the XXL
Or Fader, fuck your magazine hater
When I say that I'm the greatest I ain't talking about later
I'ma drop the album same day as Kanye
Just to show the Boyz the man now like Wanyá
And I don't mean no disrespect, I praise legends
But this what's next, the boy sick, can't disinfect
Life's a bitch and her pussy's wet
My clip is loaded and this is the kiss of... death
Me and my bitch, took a little trip
Down to the garden, took a little dip 
Apple juice falling from her lips took a little sip
Bitches come and go 
Money come and go 
Love come and go 
Bitches come and go 
Money come and go 
Love come and go 
Don't shit last, don't shit last and you know that
Went to hell, got hot didn't melt
The only man above me is God himself
All these other niggas is below me
Word to Phife, Q-Tip, Ali, and Jarobi
Cole is the King and you know that
Started with a dollar and a dream, and you know that
Never give a bird bitch a ring, you should know that
That should be my new ad lib 
I got a new one. I finally got a cool ad lib
Be at all the shows everybody be like, bitch
Or you can do the low cool shit, bitch
Yo, yo, yo pull over right here, right here, here you go
Yeah pull over right here, to the right
Pull over, pull over, pull over, pull over
Ight, look look, park right here
I'ma be out it'll be like thirty minutes tops
It'll be like thirty minutes, I'll be right back out, ight
Bitches come and go, bitches come and
Yo, yo what up, what's popping, I'm back, I'm back
Yo you got that piece ready for me, that Jesus piece
Nah the gold, the rose gold joint, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah let me see that, oh shit what is that some
What's, what the fuck is that platinum
Is that? What's that chain right there
Is that-ss-ss white gold, that's platinum
Is that plat, well niggas doing platinum again, niggas doing, niggas ain't even platinum yet right, oh shit bout to make
Yo I'm trying to bring that shit back, kill these niggas
Let me see that one too, the wat, the watch, the platinum watch

>>>Fragile Kendrick Lamar
<sos>
You said you'd never ever break... down
But here I am sweeping... pieces off of the ground
You said you'd never, ever play... to crowds
But I've seen you hoping to play songs to them now
I've spent all night long scared of tomorrow, I broke my alarm
Everything is almost lost, pick it up slow, before it's gone...
I never thought I’d be so fragile
If it didn’t break before, it’s about to
I don’t ever want to change
I don’t ever want…
Some of the people appointed to give an opinion
Never do get it
I want you to come on and gobble a jimmy and... die
N9na be givin' the remedy and why?
Critics are really the enemy and I
Can't stand the way they slam today's gifted
Effin' incredible, get fanned away with grands to pay
This jam will lay scripted
Write a rhyme and I put everything in a flow
I'm the N9ne I'ma look very mean
When a foe scribe a line but he has never been at a show
By the times it'll be better, leave it in the sto
'Cause they wrote nothin' but lies, quotes stuck in my eyes
He's a beginner and hopes for your demise, folks I'ma despise
Never do try to listen
It's real - I'm mad
Clueless when you scribble on your pad
How you gonna criticize with a chisel on your nads sizzling your ad
You don't really get why I'm so pissed? Understand this:
I'm an artist, and I'm sensitive about my shit, yes I'm
I never thought I’d be so fragile
If it didn’t break before, it’s about to
I don’t ever want to change
I don’t ever want…
Tell me that I'm famous
Tell me that my name is
Big as Venus Jupiter and then Uranus
Tell me that your anus got your head in it
I can smell the articles and know you're heinous
Tell me that you love me, always thinkin' of me
Unconditional, I'm hoping I'm your favourite
Grab a fishing pole and throw me with the sharks
That's the feelin' I get when you're concentratin'
On this pen, on this pad
Tell me you're willin' to diss on my craft
Tell me the feelin' of pickin' apart this track
Puttin' my heart and my soul in these lines
Tellin' me platinum and gold all the time
Lookin' to bury, a deep hole for mine
This is more than you, and this is more than you
And your entire building slanderin' and abusin'
What I call the realest comin' from a student
Told myself to use a poem as an UZI
Empty magazine, I seen a magazine
You seen my trigger finger, then I started shootin'
That was nicotine, I'm bout to smoke 'em all
And journalists involved should've known my music
I never thought I’d be so fragile
If it didn’t break before, it’s about to
I don’t ever want to change
I don’t ever want…

Tryna rain, tryna rain on the thunder
Tell the storm I'm new
I'ma walk, I'ma march on the regular
Painting white flags blue
Lord, forgive me, I've been running
Running blind in truth
I'ma rain, I'ma rain on this bitter love
Tell the sweet I'm new
I'm telling these tears, "Go and fall away, fall away," oh
May the last one burn into flames
Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose! Yeah
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
'Cause I need freedom, too!
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I'ma keep running
'Cause a winner don't quit on themselves
I'ma wade, I'ma wave through the waters
Tell the tide, "Don't move"
I'ma riot, I'ma riot through your borders
Lord, forgive me, I've been runnin'
Runnin' blind in truth
I'ma wade, I'ma wave through your shallow love
Tell the deep I'm new
I'm telling these tears, "Go and fall away, fall away," oh
May the last one burn into flames
Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose!
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
'Cause I need freedom, too!
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I'ma keep running
'Cause a winner don't quit on themselves
Ten Hail Marys, I meditate for practice
Channel 9 news tell me I'm movin' backwards
Eight blocks left, death is around the corner
Seven misleadin' statements 'bout my persona
Six headlights wavin' in my direction 
Five-O askin' me what's in my possession
Yeah, I keep runnin', jump in the aqueducts
Fire hydrants and hazardous
Smoke alarms on the back of us
But mama, don't cry for me, ride for me
Try for me, live for me
Breathe for me, sing for me
I could be more than I gotta be
Stole from me, lied to me, nation hypocrisy
Code on me, drive on me
Wicked, my spirit inspired me, like yeah
Open correctional gates in higher desert 
Open our mind as we cast away oppression 
Open the streets and watch our beliefs
And when they carve my name inside the concrete
I pray it forever reads
Freedom! Freedom! I can't move
Freedom, cut me loose!
Freedom! Freedom! Where are you?
'Cause I need freedom, too!
I break chains all by myself
Won't let my freedom rot in hell
Hey! I'ma keep running
'Cause a winner don't quit on themselves
What you want from me?
Is it truth you seek? Oh, father, can you hear me?
What you want from me?
Is it truth you seek? Oh, father, can you hear me?
I had my ups and downs, but I always find the inner strength to pull myself up. I was served lemons, but I made lemonade.

Why they on me? I'm flyin', sippin' low-key
I'm sippin' low-key in Onyx, rider, rider
When I'm pullin' up right beside ya
Pop star, lil' Mariah
When I text a cute game, wildness
Throw a stack on the Bible
Never Snapchat or took molly
She fall through plenty, her and all her ginnies, yeah
We at the top floor, right there off Doheny, yeah
Oh no, I can't fuck with y'all
Yeah, when I'm with my squad, I cannot do no wrong
Yeah, saucin' in the city, don't get misinformed
Yeah, they gon' pull up on you 
Yeah, we gon' do some things, some things you can't relate
Yeah, 'cause we from a place, a place you cannot stay
Oh, you can't go, oh, I don't know
Oh, back the fuck up off me 
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, you come around, yeah
You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine
Worried 'bout those comments
I'm way too numb, yeah, it's way too dumb, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, I need the Heimlich
Throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah
When you're not around
When you throw that to the side, yeah
I get those goosebumps every time
Uh, I want to press my like, yeah, I wanna press my
I want a green light, I wanna be like

I want a green light, I wanna be like, I wanna press my—
Mama dearest, spare your feelings
I'm relivin' moments, peelin' more residual
I can buy the buildin', burn the buildin'
Take your bitch, rebuild the buildin' just to fuck some more
I can justify my love for ya
And touch the sky for God to stop debating war
Put the pussy on a pedestal 
Put the pussy on a high horse
That pussy to die for
Peter Piper picked a pepper
So I could pick your brain and put your heart together
We depart the shady parts and party hard
The diamonds yours, the coupe forever
My best shot just might shoot forever like 
I get those goosebumps every time, yeah, you come around, yeah
You ease my mind, you make everything feel fine
Worried 'bout those comments
I'm way too numb, yeah, it's way too dumb, yeah

Throw that to the side, yeah

>>>The Heart Part 5 Kendrick Lamar
<sos>
As I get a little older, I realize life is perspective
And my perspective may differ from yours
I wanna say thank you to everyone that's been down with me
All my fans, all my beautiful fans
Anyone who's ever gave me a listen, all my people
I come from a generation of pain, where murder is minor
Rebellious and Margielas'll chip you for designer
Belt buckles and clout, overzealous if prone to violence
Make the wrong turn, be it will or the wheel alignment
Residue burned, mist of the inner-city
Miscommunication to keep homi' detective busy
No protection is risky
Desensitized, I vandalized pain, covered up and camouflaged
Get used to hearin' arsenal rain
Analyze, risk your life, take the charge
Homies done fucked your baby mama once you hit the yard
Twenty-three hour lockdown, then somebody called
Said your lil' nephew was shot down, the culture's involved
I done seen niggas do seventeen, hit the halfway house
Get out and get his brains blown out, lookin' to buy some weed
Car wash is played out, new GoFundMe accounts'll proceed
A brand-new victim'll shatter those dreams
But I want you to want me too 
I want the hood to want me back 
I want the hood
Look what I done for you 
Look what I done for you
I said I do this for my culture
To let y'all know what a nigga look like in a bulletproof Rover
In my mama's sofa was a doo-doo popper
Hair trigger, walk up closer, ain't no Photoshoppin'
Friends bipolar, grab you by your pockets
No option if you froze up, always play the offense
Niggas goin' to work and sellin' work, late for work
Workin' late, prayin' for work, but he on paperwork
That's the culture, point the finger, promote ya
Remote location, witness protection, they gon' hold ya
The streets got me fucked up, y'all can miss me
I wanna represent for us
New revolution was up and movin'
I'm in Argentina wiping my tears, full of confusion
Water in between us, another peer's been executed
Make amends, then find a nigga with the same skin to do it
But that's the culture, crack a bottle
Hard to deal with the pain when you're sober
By tomorrow, we forget the remains, we start over
Our foundation was trained to accept whatever follows
Scrutinize the way we live for you and I
Enemies shook my hand, I can promise I'll meet you
In the land where no equal is your equal
Never say I ain't told ya, nah
In the land where hurt people hurt more people
Fuck callin' it culture
But I want you to want me too 
I want the hood to want me back 
I want the hood
Look what I done for you 
Look what I done for you
Take the drums out
Celebrate new life when it come back around
The purpose is in the lessons we learnin' now
Sacrifice personal gain over everything
Just to see the next generation better than ours
I wasn't perfect, the skin I was in had truly suffered
Temptation, impatience, everything that the body nurtures
I felt the good, I felt the bad, and I felt the worry
But all-in-all, my productivity had stayed urgent
Face your fears, always knew that I would make it here
Where the energy is magnified and persevered
Consciousness is synchronized and crystal-clear
Euphoria is glorified and made His
Reflectin' on my life and what I done
Paid dues, made rules, change outta love
Them same views made schools change curriculums
But didn't change me starin' down the barrel of the gun
Should I feel resentful I didn't see my full potential?
Should I feel regret about the good that I was into?
Everything is everything, this ain't coincidental
I woke up that morning with more heart to give you
As I bleed through the speakers, feel my presence
To my brother, to my kids, I'm in Heaven
To my mother, to my sis, I'm in Heaven
To my father, to my wife, I am serious, this is Heaven
To my friends, make sure you countin' them blessings
To my fans, make sure you make them investments
And to the killer that sped up my demise
I forgive you, just know your soul's in question
I seen the pain in your pupil when that trigger had squeezed
And though you did me gruesome, I was surely relieved
I completed my mission, wasn't ready to leave
But fulfilled my days, my Creator was pleased
I can't stress how I love y'all
I don't need to be in flesh just to hug y'all
The memories recollect just because y'all
Celebrate me with respect
The unity we protect is above all
And Sam, I'll be watchin' over you
Make sure my kids watch all my interviews
Make sure you live out our dreams we produced
Keep that genius in your brain on the move
And to my neighborhood, let the good prevail
Make sure them babies and the leaders outta jail
Look for salvation when troubles get real
'Cause you can't help the world until you help yourself
And I can't blame the hood the day that I was killed
Y'all had to see it, that's the only way to feel
And though my physical won't reap the benefits
The energy that carry on emits still
>>>Holy Key Kendrick Lamar
<sos>
Doing what I gotta do, aaaa
We the best music...
I guess I'm on my Don shit
Straight up, late nights mixed with early days
It'll probably be that way until the pearly gates
Stress weighing on me, they want me to nervous break
These hoes showing fake love when I prefer the hate, man
Sheesh, at least if you real then I have to respect it
Realize the energy you give is what you manifested
So understand we positive as could be
The vision is still intact, the show is fresh out of seats
Boy it's never going south 'less we down in South Beach
Khaled on the jet skis, preaching what you believe in
Everything fast 'cept the food, watch what we eating
If it add a couple years to our life, then we might go vegan
Woah, I hear a little bit of me in all your favorite rappers
You know it's true, bitch I need respect due
Now or later, either way I'ma take it
Just like it's fuckin' taxes
No wonder I'm on fire, I done been to hell and back bitch
Lately I been living life in detachment
I practice seven spiritual laws and cut off distractions
We been all in the Hollywood Hills, and never been acting
Detroit gave me an accent and Christ gave me his passion
Father help us, police doing target practice with real bodies
Mommas in the streets, crying, standing over a still body
Niggas over stressing, we under investigation
Every day off to the races, can't fuck with you if you racist
Beat your ass until you purple
They can't even tell what your race is
Doctor King meet Dr. Dre
Except this doctor lost all his patience
Have you tied up in a basement
With you and your partner facing adjacent
Until you deposit payment or reparations
If you shoot me then you gotta deal with a holy me
It feel like I'm finally free and unlock my spirit with the holy key
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy,  holy key
Everything I touch may disintegrate into dust 
Everything I trust may dishonor me in disgust 
Everything is everything, affidavits and wedding rings
Out for blood on my higher horse, I report what it was
I don't wear crosses no more, Yeshua's coming back
I ain't scared of losses no more, I see life in that
I don't resonate with the concept of love and hate
Cause your perspective is less effective and rather fake
The universe and the heavens work in my DNA
Kendrick said "Fuck Mother Earth," that's PSA
The land of the wicked, the foundation of Lucifer's spirit
Walking zombies and spellcatchers, I pray for forgiveness
Uncle Bobby and Paul June is lost again
The underworld and the fourth dimension, my family's in
The big money, the fast cars, my life produced
The blocks I connected while re-building this Rubik's cube
So what you look up to?
Fame and fortune, bitches, Porsches
Sources with designer thing
Brand endorsement joining forces with sorcerers signing me
Law enforcement their forces, tortures us with violent speed
Fuck your boss's employment my joy is to see all you bleed
Two new Royce's with choices of color my desire need
Crab and Oyster with gorgeous abortions, I require thee
Flesh and poison the point is the reason
You won't die in peace
Open door for my boy, now they eating, we say, finally
I destroy and divorce what you eating, don't you hire me
Tape recording my voices and tweak it
Let's play hide and seek
War distortion and forfeit this evening, you should try at least
I'm restoring the portrait of feasting, nigga, I am beast
I don't like to sleep, I'm up like coyote, I might OD
Hair like ODB, I'm off a higher need
Khaled is valid, I been looking for inspiration
But when you the only king, you the only one in the matrix
Oh yeah, mhm yeah
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy, holy key
And I'ma celebrate it for a long time
They tried but couldn't break me, now it's all mine
Surrounded by my angels and we all shine
Holy, holy, holy,  holy key
Holy, Holy key, holy

>>>Hood Gone Love It Kendrick Lamar
<sos>
Keepin' it G ain't nothin' 
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it 
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public 
I got the whole block bumpin' 
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it 
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public 
Na na na na now now, you know what this is
Tell 'em it's a celebration, bitches
With the barbeque pits and the mini-bikes
Mini-skirts, Hennessy's, and the Miller Lites
Domino tables, who got big 6?
Where I'm from we do concrete backflips
Flip flop, flip flop, flip flop back
To the ghetto's where I bring hip hop back
Real niggas love me, they tell me "Keep it pushin'!"
The only niggas speak from way inside Central Bookings
County jails and the lock downs up north
Said I should have it if Scarface pass the torch
That's how they feel, Jack, built much more than rap
This that project haircut in the cul-de-sac
This is where Jose front you them quarters at
Meet your quota whenever I put a quote on a track, nigga
Keepin' it G ain't nothin' 
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it 
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public 
I got the whole block bumpin' 
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it 
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public 
From Compton to Baltimore I'ma kill it
I buy a morgue in the minute
The public house, the plastic couch of a section 8 tenant
The Regal window is tinted
The air conditioner broke
But I'm cool enough to ensure you my ride is an Eskimo
 And I peel off
In the midst of gettin' my thrills off
And I thrive off energies from inner cities that we lost 
I'm puttin' the ghetto on top of my back
And I live in the back of the jungle
Lions, tigers, bears, oh my
Hear the siren, walk up,  drive-by
Shooters, looters, federal fed intruders
The engines on back of scooters
The real can recognize real
And we need to know just who you are
You are in the presence of many presents
Kendrick the gift for the future, oh yeah, I said it
Thug life, good kid, mad city
Mad respect representin' the hub right
Keepin' it G ain't nothin' 
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it 
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public 
I got the whole block bumpin' 
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it 
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public 
The home girls tell me I'm the shit
I break 'em off so they can buy some outfits
I buy they sons a pack of pampers, some new Jordan's
Give 'em the game, school 'em on what's really important
It's how I was raised, the OG's had me
Thirteen, fresh off the porch, slangin' cavi
But I'm wiser now, show all my young niggas
There's other ways you get them dollars and funds, nigga
Comin' down in an old school, so cool
Whip like a fire ball; call it Goku
You don't know the tribulations that we go through
Put your ears to the speakers, I'ma show you
I paint the picture so perfect
In my CD, you see Mona Lisa in person
Courtesy of a hunnit beat
Got my Crips and esse's at arm reach; one West
Keepin' it G ain't nothin' 
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it 
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public 
I got the whole block bumpin' 
You ain't gotta like it, ‘cause the hood gone love it 
Watch a young nigga show his ass out in public

>>>How Many Drinks? Kendrick Lamar
<sos>
Frustration 
Hesitation 
Come closer baby 
One question: Am I moving too fast?
Cause' I ain't leaving alone- feel like I could be honest babe
We both know that we're grown
That's why I wanna know
How many drinks would it take you to leave with me?
Yeah you look good, and I got money
But I don't wanna waste my time
Back of my mind, I'm hoping you say two or three
You look good; we came to party
But I don't wanna waste my time
Temptation 
Sweet persuasion, oh 
Come closer baby 
Impassioned 
Cause' I ain't leaving alone- feel like I could be honest babe
We both know that we're grown
That's why I wanna know
How many drinks would it take you to leave with me?
Yeah you look good, and I got money
But I don't wanna waste my time
Back of my mind, I'm hoping you say two or three
You look good; we came to party
But I don't wanna waste my time
Aha, and what do we have
Your empty heart and my empty bottle and yellow cab
That you are likely to catch 'cause your latest ex made you mad
So I figured the perfect catch would be you if I made the pass
Pool full of liquor then we dive - in it
Knowing if I lick her I might die - in it
Then reincarnate as a fly - gymnast
Just to flip my tongue on you
State your name, live in the moment
It’s your time to own it, I see it in you baby
She tell me that she never give the first night away
And life is a bitch, but every dog has its day
Holla pull up, pull up, bring it back, come rewind
Pull up them big trucks, that pack come behind
Pool full of liquor then we die - in it
Pull 'em to the side, let me slide up in it
Or waste your time, or waste your time
Or waste our time, baby it's alright
Baby it's alright, baby it's alright yeah
Oh it's alright now
I don't wanna waste my time, no
I don't wanna waste no time, oh no
I don't wanna waste your time, babe
I don't wanna waste our time
Oh my time, Oh whoaaa, now
How many drinks would it take you to leave with me? 
Yeah you look good, and I got money
But I don't wanna waste my time 
Back of my mind, I'm hoping you say two or three 
You look good; we came to party
But I don't wanna waste my time
No-no-no. I ain't judgin' if you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight
What? More power to you if you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight
I ain't judgin' if you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight
What? More power to you if you do decide that you might be ___ing tonight
Let's go, shit we only live once right?
I mean, where's the fun in forever anyway?

Nobody pray for me
It been that day for me
Ayy, I remember syrup sandwiches and crime allowances
Finesse a nigga with some counterfeits, but now I'm countin’ this
Parmesan where my accountant lives, in fact, I'm downin' this
D’USSÉ with my boo bae, tastes like Kool-Aid for the analysts
Girl, I can buy your ass the world with my paystub
Ooh, that pussy good, won't you sit it on my taste bloods?
I get way too petty once you let me do the extras
Pull up on your block, then break it down: we playin' Tetris
AM to the PM, PM to the AM, funk
Piss out your per diem, you just gotta hate 'em, funk
If I quit your BM, I still ride Mercedes, funk
If I quit this season, I still be the greatest, funk
My left stroke just went viral
Right stroke put lil' baby in a spiral
Soprano C, we like to keep it on a high note
It's levels to it, you and I know

Get the fuck off my dick, that ain't right
I make a play fucking up your whole life
I'm so fuckin' sick and tired of the Photoshop
Show me somethin' natural like afro on Richard Pryor
Show me somethin' natural like ass with some stretch marks
Still I take you down right on your mama couch in Polo socks
Ayy, this shit way too crazy, ayy, you do not amaze me, ayy

2 ContributorsGods Plan Remix LyricsIntro
Gods plan was to leave me in the van
Runnin' on my own hands
Call that shit a handstand
I was never meant to make it this far
Everybody knows that I'm subpar
Until I start rapping I'm a fucking god
Thats why its gods plan not ours
Everybody knows where I go
Everybody fucking with the flow
Mixing them beats making rolls
Poppin off the pillie Imma row
I dont wanna play in the snow, less you talking coke, less you talkin both
And them boat rules Panama and Im fucking talking whole school
Fucking with them bitches all day
Sorry, I dont really fuck wit bitches like that no more
I only got one girl hold on
Running with the bands in the hand
Put a fucking band in to plant
Everybody hopping in a van
You might also likeVerse #2
Fuck on me ,yeah bitch fuck on me
But I won't fuck back maybe leave a text or three
Freestyling is a fucking rap ting
And I fucking rat on you if you fucking rat on me 
Unless you be snitching for no reason
Then i pop you flakes in a season
Season you like steak ain't no reason
Fuckin all these hoes what I thinking
But i got one girl for the reason
Fucking with everyone fleekin'
Everybody knows what my reason
I dont like no private school ting
Tryna get to south but I can't 
Fucking with my boy from the clan
Boof on the beat like
Spitting bars like I'm on average
Kendrick Lamar I past him
King Los still rapping 
Guns still rapping, guns still wrapped in the bag, with the brown bag
They say its beer but it ain't
They got gat and they running wit all the rats as they shooting back at the rats
Fucking with the mans for a reason
Got the bag rappin' for threes and
With my girl always be thinking
What the fuck he doing for no reason
Fucking with the thinking
What in the world are they thinking
Fucking with them dont believe in no fucking reason

>>>It's On Again Kendrick Lamar
<sos>
And everybody know the story of David and Goliath
But this is bigger than triumph
This is for the warrior, this is for you and I
This is for euphoria, give me a piece of mind
God is recording this, won't you look in the sky?
Tell him that you got the behavior of your neighbor
Even when stability's never in your favor
Fly with the turbulence, only last a minute
Land on your dreams, and recognize you live it
Walk through the valley and peaks, with bare feet
Run through the flames, that's more passion for me
I passed testimony just so the world can see
My battle wounds on me, you watching me lick ‘em clean
I know, I know, my pride, my goals, my highs, my lows
I know, I know, it's mind control
I know I could prosper, no impostor, prosecute my posture
I stand up and I stand by ya, what?
I am a freedom fighter, the name that history wrote
And even through disaster, eye of the tiger for hope
I'm trying to find my way back, there's no day off for heroes
And even when I'm tired, go is the only word I know
And the night is takin' over, and the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen, and it seems like fate has spoken
When it seems your faith has broken, by the second, losin' focus
Ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off
Unless you move forward
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
I'll simply say "it's on again, it's on again," whoa-oh
The world don't stop, it's on again, it's on again, whoa-oh
I am a lonely hero, trying to fight my battles
Life likes to blow the cold wind, sometimes it freezes my shadow
In the midst of all this darkness, I sacrifice my ego
There ain't no room for selfish, we do it for the people
And the night is takin' over, and the moonlight gets exposure
And the players have been chosen, and it seems like fate has spoken
When it seems your faith has broken, by the second, losin' focus
Ain't no way to get off, get off, get off, get off
Unless you move forward
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
I'll simply say "it's on again, it's on again," whoa-oh
The world don't stop, it's on again, it's on again, whoa-oh
Say the work don't stop, cause they don't stop
And everybody here tryna get on top
Everybody from the burbs down to the block
Gotta hold on tight and don't let go, let go
Huh, so you think you hot?
Gotta grind hard, give it all you got
You can have, or you can have not
You see that a lot in the ghetto, ghetto
I bet they wonder how I go on, go on
I'll simply say "it's on again, it's on again," whoa-oh
The world don't stop, it's on again, it's on again, whoa-oh

I got a bone to pick
I don't want you monkey-mouth motherfuckers
Sittin' in my throne again
Ayy, ayy, nigga, what's happenin'?
K-Dot back in the hood, nigga!
I'm mad , but I ain't stressin'
True friends, one question
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams—
The yam is the power that be
You can smell it when I'm walkin' down the street
I can dig rappin', but a rapper with a ghostwriter?
What the fuck happened? 
I swore I wouldn't tell, but most of y'all sharing bars
Like you got the bottom bunk in a two-man cell 
Something's in the water 
And if I gotta brown-nose for some gold
Then I'd rather be a bum than a motherfuckin' baller 
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
When you got the yams—
The yam brought it out of Richard Pryor
Manipulated Bill Clinton with desires
Twenty-four-seven, three-sixty-five days times two
I was contemplatin' gettin' off stage
Just to go back to the hood, see my enemy, and say… 
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
I was gonna kill a couple rappers, but they did it to themselves
Everybody's suicidal, they ain't even need my help
This shit is elementary, I'll probably go to jail
If I shoot at your identity and bounce to the left
Stuck a flag in my city, everybody's screamin', "Compton!"
I should probably run for mayor when I'm done, to be honest
And I put that on my momma and my baby boo too
Twenty million walkin' out the court buildin', woo-woo!
Aw, yeah, fuck the judge
I made it past twenty-five, and there I was
A little nappy-headed nigga with the world behind him
Life ain't shit but a fat vagina
Screamin', "Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?"
Limo tinted with the gold plates
Straight from the bottom, this the belly of the beast
From a peasant to a prince to a motherfuckin' king 
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'—*Gunshot*
By the time you hear the next pop
The funk shall be within you—*Gunshot*
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him
King Kunta, black man taking no losses, oh yeah
Bitch, where you when I was walkin'?
Now I run the game, got the whole world talkin'
King Kunta, everybody wanna cut the legs off him

Don’t wrap it up in gold
Don’t hide it behind the sun
Just give it to me as it is
And let it stand
Don’t fly it like a kite
It needs no excuse
Just bring it down
Let eyes that are in pain look upon it
In all its glory
Let us move on
For this is short
And it will pass
Let us move on
For this is short
And it will pass
For every voice that is lifted
In reverence and pain
And let love not be chained
We should feel what we can stand
And let us be alive
That we’ve done all we can
Let hearts that are frozen get to see it
In all its glory
Let us move on
For this is short
And it will pass
Let us move on
For this is short
And it will pass
And let all that is lost be forgotten
And it will pass
So let all that is lost be forgotten
Let us move on
Like the waters in the open sea
When tribulations come all we can say is hopefully
And yesterday you could probably say there's no hope for me
But today I'm overly dedicated, I'm 'posed to be
A testimony for broken hearts in the city
You either crash landing or planning on flying with me
Misery loves standing behind its company, well
Vividly I can see that your feelings would like to dwell
On our past encounters, reaching over the counter
Told me that it's a appealing to pop a pill, that's a downer
I heard emotions burn deep
I heard when you fall out of love the drop is steep
I heard when you see a thug, that's what you try be
Got these burdens under my wings, but I'm still free
Cause I can make the decision to let it all go away
Before I ever run astray I'll look you in the eye and say
Let us move on
For this is short
And it will pass
Let us move on
For this is short
And it will pass

Ooh, that pussy good, it's to die for 
It's a secret society
All we ask is trust 
All we got is us
Kung Fu Kenny now
My resume is real enough for two millennium
A better way to make a wave, stop defendin' them
I meditate and moderate all of my wins again
I'm hangin' on the fence again
I'm always on your mind
I put my lyric and my lifeline on the line
And ain't no limit when I might shine, might grind
You rollin' with it at the right time, right now
Bad girl RiRi now
Swerve, swerve, swerve, swerve, leave it now
On your pulse like it’s EDM
Gas in the bitch like it’s premium
Haul ass on a bitch all in the fast lane
Been a bad bitch way before any cash came
I'm established, hundred carats on my name
Run the atlas, I’m a natural, I'm alright
I'm a savage, I'm a asshole, I’m a king
Shimmy ya, shimmy ya, shimmy ya rah 
You can tell your nigga he can meet me outside 
You can babysit him when I leave him outside
Ain't no other love like the one I know
I done been down so long lost hope
I done came down so hard I slowed
Honestly forever, all a real nigga want
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up 
All I want tonight is just to get high up 
All I want is, all I want is
10-4, no switchin' sides
You actin' shifty, you don't vibe
With me no more, I need
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it money? Is it fame? Is it weed? Is it drink?
Is it comin' down with the loud pipes in the rain?
Big chillin', only for the power in your name
Tell me who you loyal to
Is it love for the streets when the lights get dark?
Is it unconditional when the 'Rari don't start?
Tell me when your loyalty is comin' from the heart
Tell me who you loyal to
Do it start with your woman or your man? 
Do it end with your family and friends? 
Are you loyal to yourself in advance?
I said, tell me who you loyal to
Is it anybody that you would lie for?
Anybody you would slide for?
Anybody you would die for?
That's what God for
I said I'm geeked and I'm fired up 
All I want tonight is just to get high up 
All I want is, all I want is
10-4, no switchin' sides
You actin' shifty, you don't vibe

It's so hard to be humble
It's so hard to be

Am I asking too much?
Let me put the head in
Ooh, I don't want more than that; girl, I respect the cat
I promise, just a touch
Let me put the head in
If it's okay; she said, "It's okay"
Yeah, I need everybody's motherfuckin' hands up right now
I need everybody's motherfuckin'—
Door and his Nike Air Rattles
Rush the fire exit, no time for battles
Well I, I never expected
This that new shit
This that new, new shit
Wake up in the mornin', thinkin' 'bout money, kick your feet up
Watch you a comedy, take a shit, then roll some weed up
Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch
Don't go to work today, cop you a fit
Or maybe some kicks and make you—
Door and his Nike Air Rattles

Go hit you a lick, go fuck on a bitch, don't go to work today
Cop you a fit or maybe some kicks and make it work today
Hang with the homies, stunt on your baby mama
Sip some lean, go get a pistol, shoot out the window
Bet your favorite team, play you some Madden
Go to the club or your mama house
Whatever you doing, just make it count 
Wake up in the morning, thinking 'bout money, kick your feet up
Hop in the shower, put on your makeup, lace your weave up
Touch on yourself, call up your nigga, tell him he ain't shit
Credit card scam, get you a Visa, make it pay your rent
Hop on the 'Gram, flex on the bitches that be hatin' on you
Pop you a pill, call up your bitches, have 'em waitin' on you
Go to the club, have you some fun, make that ass bounce
It's whatever, just make it count

If it's okay; she said, "It's okay"
I wake in the morning, my head spinning from the last night
Both in a trance, feelings are dead—what a fast life
Manager called, the lobby call is 11:30
Did this before, promised myself I'd be a hour early
Room full of clothes, bag full of money: call it loose change
Fumbled my jewelry, 100K, I lost a new chain
Hop on the bird, hit the next city for another M
Take me a nap then do it again
We all woke up, tryna tune to the daily news
Looking for confirmation, hoping election wasn't true
All of us worried, all of us buried, in our feelings deep
None of us married to his proposal, make us feel cheap
Stale and sad, distraught and mad, tell the neighbor 'bout it—
Bet they agree, parade the streets with your voice proudly
Time passing, things change
Reverting back to our daily programs, stuck in our ways
Lately, I feel like I been lusting over the fame
Lately, we lust on the same routine of shame
Lately  Lately, my lust been heightened 
Lately, it's all contradiction 
Lately, I lust over self 
Lately, in James 4:4 says
"Friend of the world is enemy of the Lord"
Brace yourself: Lust is all yours
I need some water
Something came over me
Way too hot to simmer down, might as well overheat
Too close to comfort
As blood rush my favorite vein
Heartbeat racing like a junkie's
I just need you to want me

Ayy, in my apartment a long time ago
I knew a bad bitch, but she was kinda slow
Still gave it up when it's a few of us
She let me finger-fuck her on the school bus
We used to cut school with her and run train
She wanted to hang with us, we wanted one thang
Just penetratin' that throat, dawg
She choked on it like smoke, dawg
But whenever I fucked up my re-up
In a dice game I go see her
She'll give me enough to buy a quarter ounce
And then blow a blunt of that reefer
She used to buy a nigga new sneakers
Pay the bill on my beeper
Just so she can page to put a "69"
And I know it time to go freak her
Then one day I just asked her
"Why you always give your ass up?
I mean, damn, these hoes get paid
All you do is get laid—this shit don't add up."
She said, "Tip, all I wanna do is feel love
Even if I know it ain't real love
Even if I know a nigga only finna hit it
And then never call back, I still fuck."
And that's fucked up, but she so trill
I need somethin', she go steal
When the trap hot and police ride
Nigga, guess where we go chill?
For 'bout four years she held dope
And my four pounds 'til it go down
I remember shawty, she stayed down
I won't say her name ‘cause she married now
When the lights go out
And I'm in my bed
I think of all the madness in my head
All of the things that I did back then
When I'm in my bed
I think of all the memories I've had
All of the things I did back then
She would always turn heads when she'd fall through
She would always make moves how a boss do
And she never gave any nigga time of day
But she the chick all the niggas tried to talk to
But when it came to me, she had a thing for me
When we kicked it she roll up the weed for me
And we'd both cut class post up in the cut steady
Watchin' just to see if the police comin'
We got close over time, her and I
Right around the time that I first got signed
Come to think about it I was 'bout 17
I ain't even have a license, couldn't even drive
I was goin' back and forth with each flight
Another show after show, each night
She became so suspicious of these other bitches
She'd go through my phone and we'd fight
Talk about torn between the two
Wasn't really much more that we could do
Wasn't really much space for us
But she stayed down with every tour she seen me do
But I guess one night I had a few
Huh, one night I had a few
Yeah, this little chick that caught my eye
I told her: "Hurry up, meet me at the room!"
And no, I didn't have a contraceptive
What my common sense neglected
And two months later, next thing I know
I got a text that said "I'm pregnant"
And you can almost bet she kept it
And that's the reason why you left me
On top of all that, it wasn't even mine
I went and got paternity tested—damn!
When the lights go out
And I'm in my bed
I think of all the madness in my head
All of the things that I did back then
When I'm in my bed
I think of all the memories I've had
All of the things I did back then
Wait, hol' up, is that you?
With them big ol' thighs after school?
Jay 305 had gave me high five
When I said I’m in hot pursuit
You said, "I won’t ride until Kendrick drive
A new Monte Carlo that cruise"
And that shot my pride, I tried to improv
But no freestyle I never do
You lookin' for the nigga with the tallest 'fetti
You overlookin' every nigga that ain’t quite ready
To make it rain on you like I'm about to break a levee
Hol' up, that pussy petty
Yeah, your nails did, your hair did
Your cell phone is selfish
It only got numbers that come with a Hummer
Her new prima donna I smelt it
Tried to make you mine, ho!
Tried to make some time, ho!
But I ain’t got the time or the patience
To stop and wait in line, ho!
Her dreams holds Versace
She fall for Armani
Only deal with rich niggas—fuck you and Mick Romney!
I’m grown now, I’m on my own now
Change my phone now when I get home now
Fast forward, wait, is that you?
With them big ol' thighs after school?
And your three kids and three baby daddies
Same car note that’s overdue? I know
When the lights go out
And I'm in my bed
I think of all the madness in my head
All of the things that I did back then
When I'm in my bed
I think of all the memories I've had
All of the things I did back then

I got a story to tell, you know that I cherish thee
Hope it ain't too many feelings involved
I see niggas in this bitch stunting, popping bottles
Getting drunk with these bitches
Then when they leave, they get followed
Fall asleep with that bitch
And really don't know much about her
Then she let us in, we take all of your shit
And when you wake up, she help you try to find it, I love her
I be with bitches that be with bitches
That be with niggas with riches
I tell her, "Get him," she say, "I got you"
I say, "No, bitch, I said get him" 
And they so pretty, and they hair lengthy
He hit it and sleep on her titties
Then she give us the word, we come through with AKs
It's a stick-up, she scream like a victim, now you
Feeling so silly, I smoke color purple
I'm up in here feeling like Celie, ooh
Nappy-ass dreads, what's that you say?
Watch your mouth, Milli Vanilli, ooh
You can get snaked, you can get faked
Out by the bitch that you feeling 'cause you
Thought that she was an angel, that bitch ain't no angel
I treat her halo like a frisbee, and you
Tell her your business, she tell me your business
You tell that bitch what you feeling
All of the beans you be spilling, to you
She lie through her teeth; cavities, fillings
She know where you hide it, tell me where it's hidden
She know when you gone, tell me when to visit
We break in your home and take the specifics
And meanwhile, the bitch is on vacation with him
So she don't get blamed, we don't snatch chains
We find out addresses, and we don't leave messes
You'll only know that it's gone when you checking
Then your first thought is to start second guessing
She say, "What's wrong?" He say, "Nothing, keep resting,"
She say, "What's missing?"—"How you know something missing?"
He scratched his head, she say, "Get back in bed,"
Then she gave him some head, boy, you can't trust them bitches
And then she say, "Ooh"
I see niggas in this bitch stunting, popping bottles
Getting drunk with these bitches
Then when they leave, they get followed
I be with bitches that know the bitches
That's with the niggas we following
Get them on the line, stay two cars behind
And tell them hoes, "Don't be so obvious!"
Mona Lisa, long hair, don't care
She handle the business and don't ever tell
She bite the bullet and cough up the shell
She tell 'em, "Ooh, daddy, let's go to your place,"
And if he say yeah,  then we meet 'em there
She feed him lies with his silverware
She don't want love, she just want her share, I
Know a bitch named Liz
This nigga think she his 'cause she tell him that it is
So, he tell her all his secrets, he tell her all his fears
And then she tell me, and I be all ears
Then I go and tell my people, and they already know it
And then I call Liz, and she say he coming over
I say, "Good girl, just remember what I told you"
She gave me a salute, I say, "Girl, you're a soldier!"
We waiting outside, watch him pull up
Walk up to the door, and right before he knocked
She open the door naked, she left it unlocked
They started French kissing so he didn't see moi
And then she let him in, they stopped on the couch
Music up loud with his head in the clouds
Turn that shit down, and I scared the piss out him
Piss a nigga off, put the gun to his frown
"Nigga, turn around, I ain't here to fuck around
I ain't here to fuck around, caught you with your pants down
You know what it is, put your fucking hands up!
Liz, that's enough, you can put your hands down"
Then he looked dead at her and he shook his head at her
She a good actress, and you a dead actor
You'll be dead after we get what we after
If Liz call you daddy, she 'bout to be a bastard, oh
I got way too many bitches that do anything for me, nigga
But think for me, nigga
Send her to you like she ain't for me, nigga
I hope you alone like bankruptcy, nigga
She pour you a drink, that drink on me, nigga
She slip something in it, now faint for me, nigga
Mona Lisa, I done painted the picture
Mo-Mona Lisa, out the frame on these niggas
Pussy got you out of character, nigga
You fall for these hoes off your ladder, my nigga
Take everything that you have 'til you don't even have
An opinion, we have your attention
And now you looking down a barrel though, nigga
Now she looking for her pantyhose, nigga
We just looking for the casserole, nigga
But she gon' show us where you stash it though, nigga, Mona
Ah, every day she wake up with a different color makeup
And a promise he gon' take her to the movie and the mall
Chilling with the Laker, on the floor, fourth quarter
For a minute on the clock, Black Mamba with the ball
Paparazzi looking at 'em both, popping up and take a picture, uh
Probably on an internet blog
In a minute, he gon' be admitting that he love her
On his mother, man, he want to meet her mother by tomorrow
Pussy good enough, it got him sinning in the walls
And he digging in it like he living in it, make a new religion with it
Man, a nigga 'bout to go against God
Poetry in the pear trees
Sweet tone like a hummingbird when she asked him
Did he want to make love in a yellow taxi?
Never gave two fucks, jumped in the backseat
Woke up in the morning to The Great Gatsby
Then he dogged it again like the bitch Lassie
I'm a dog in the wind, I'm a pet laughing
I'ma call up again like I did last week
Make good with the friend, and I'm all jazzy
Britney with the twin and the girl, Ashley
Found out that I fucked, he was unhappy
Bitch, I never let the bullshit get past me
Better yet, I wanna break up, don't you ask me
'Bout no motherfucking double standard, acting
Fucking on another nigga, that's a negative alone
But you sucked his dick? That's just nasty
Matter fact, bitch, gimme your phone! 
You fucking with Wayne's!? 
Bitch, gimme your phone! 
He on your fucking ringtone!? Is that the shit that you do!?
Touching yourself, looking at Kendrick videos
Jump on the internet, watching his interviews
I don't know what the fuck lately gotten into you
Tell me who love you, I bet I love harder
Forgot all the shit that I did for your daughter?
The Pampers, the Pedialyte and my momma
Daycare after school and she never did charge ya
You scandalous as fuck, and I hope you blow up
You know what? I give up, let me go get my gun
I got one in the chamber I'm planning on aiming
Goddammit, you know that the damage is done
Bitch, I'm emotional 'cause I'm in stress
I'm not supposed to go through this, I guess
Since you like rappers that's killing that pussy, I'm killing myself
She say, "Ooh, daddy, ooh,"
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Ooh, fake smile 
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
She say, "Ooh," dead emotion 
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa
Now he get the picture
Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, yeah

Hello, new world, all the boys and girls
I got some true stories to tell
You're back outside, but they still lied
Take off the foo-foo, take off the clout chase, take off the Wi-Fi
Take off the money phone, take off the car loan, take off the flex and the white lies
Take off the weird-ass jewelry, I'ma take ten steps, then I'm taking off top five
Take off them fabricated streams and them microwave memes, it's a real world outside 
Take off your idols, take off the runway, I take off to Cairo 
Take off to Saint-Tropez, five-day stay, take a quarter mill', hell, if I know 
Take off the front flag, take off perception, take off the cop with the eye patch 
Take off the unloyal, take off the unsure, take off decisions I lack 
Take off the fake deep, take off the fake woke, take off the, "I'm broke, I care" 
Take off the gossip, take off the new logic that if I'm rich, I'm rare 
Take off the Chanel, take off the Dolce, take off the Birkin bag
Take all that designer bullshit off, and what do you have?
Bitch, huh, huh, ugh
You ugly as fuck 
Huh, two ATMs 
You steppin' or what? 
Who you think they talk about?
Talk about us 
Who you think they copy off? 
Copy off us 
The world in a panic, the women is stranded, the men on a run
The prophets abandoned, the law take advantage, the market is crashin', the industry wants
Niggas and bitches to sleep in a box while they makin' a mockery followin' us
This ain't Monopoly, watchin' for love, this ain't monogamy, y'all gettin' fucked
Jumpin' on what the hell is that? I gotta relax when I feel 
All my descendants, they come in my sleep and say I am too real 
I'm done with the sensitive, takin' it personal, done with the black and the white, the wrong and the right
You hopin' for change and clericals, I know the feelings that came with burial's cries
Bitch, huh, huh, ugh
You ugly as fuck 
Huh, two ATMs 
You steppin' or what? 
Who you think they talk about?
Talk about us 
Who you think they copy off? 
Servin' up a look, dancin' in a drought
Hello to the big stepper, never losin' count
Ventin' in the safe house
Ventin' in the sa—
Can I vent all my truth? I got nothin' to lose, I got problems and pools, I can swim on my faith
Cameras movin' whenever I'm movin', the family suin' whatever I make
Murder is stackin', the president actin', the government taxin' my funds in the bank
Homies attracting the feds when I'm bracking, look at my reaction, my pupils on skates 
Let's think about this for a second 
Tell me what you would do for aesthetic 
Would you sell your soul on credit? 
Would you sell your bro for leverage? 
Where the hypocrites at?
What community feel they the only ones relevant? 
Where the hypocrites at?
What community feel they the only ones relevant? 
You outta pocket, yeah, you outta pocket 
You entertain the mediocre, need to stop it 
You entertainin' old friends when they toxic 
What your life like? Bullshit and gossip 
What the fuck is cancel culture, dawg?
Say what I want about you niggas, I'm like Oprah, dawg
I treat you crackers like I'm Jigga, watch, I own it all
Oh, you worried 'bout a critic? That ain't protocol

>>>Never Catch Me Kendrick Lamar
<sos>
I can see the darkness in me and it's quite amazing
Life and death is no mystery and I wanna taste it
Step inside of my mind and you'll find curiosity, animosity
High philosophy, hyper prophesied meditation
Reminisce on my wonder years and I wonder here
Sentiments of my words ain't been so sincere
The sentiment of my nerves that I just persevere
The big thought of fallin' off disappeared to my fate
They say that Heaven's real
Analyze my demise, I say I'm super anxious
Recognize I deprive this feeling and then I embrace it
Vandalizing these walls only if they could talk
Conversations won't contemplate to my dark thoughts
Lookin' down on my soul now, tell me I'm in control now
Tell me I can live long and I can live wrong and I can live right
And I can sing song and I can unite the you that I love
You that I like, look at my life and tell me I fight
This that final destination, this that find some information
This that find some inspiration, this that crack, the installation
This that quantum jump and that fist pump and that bomb detonation
Please don't bomb my nation, embalming fluid waiting
I got mind control when I'm here, you gon' hate me when I'm gone
Ain't no blood pumpin' no fear, I got hope inside of my bones
This that life beyond your own life, this ain't physical for mankind
This that out-of-body experience, no coincidence you been died
Say you will never ever catch me, no, no, no
Say you will never ever catch me
Say you will never ever

With poetic justice, poetic justice

I mean, I write poems in these songs dedicated to you when
You're in the mood for empathy, there's blood in my pen
Better yet, where your friends and 'em? I really wanna know you all
I really wanna show you off, fuck that, pour up plenty

You called up your girlfriends and y'all curled in that little bitty Range, I heard that

Livin' my life in the margin and that metaphor was proof, I'm talkin'

If I told you that a flower bloomed in a dark room, would you trust it?
I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
It's you lookin' in the mirror, love is not just a verb
It's you lookin' for it, maybe, call me crazy, we can both be insane
A fatal attraction is common, and what we have common is pain
I mean, you need to hear this, love is not just a verb
And I can see power steerin', sex drive when you swerve
I want that interference, it's coherent, I can hear it, mhmm
That's your heartbeat, it either caught me or it called me, mhmm
Read slow and you'll find gold mines in these lines

I'm tryna fight back tears, flood on my doorsteps
Life a livin' hell, puddles of blood in the streets
Shooters on top of the building, government aid ain't relief
Earthquake, the body dropped, the ground breaks
The poor run with smoke lungs and Scarface
Who need a hero? 
You need a hero, look in the mirror, there go your hero
Who on the front lines at ground zero? 
My heart don't skip a beat, even when hard times bumps the needle
Mass destruction and mass corruption, the souls of sufferin' men
Clutchin' on deaf ears again, rapture is comin'
It's all prophecy and if I gotta be
Sacrificed for the greater good then that's what it gotta be
Who gon' pray for me? 
Take my pain for me? 
Save my soul for me? 
'Cause I'm alone, you see 
If I'm gon' die for you 
If I'm gon' kill for you 
Then I'll spill this blood for you, hey
Who gon' pray for me? 
Take my pain for me? 
Save my soul for me? 
'Cause I'm alone, you see 
If I'm gon' die for you 
If I'm gon' kill for you 
Then I'll spill this blood for you, hey
Just in case my faith go, I'll live by my own law
I'll live by my own law, I'll live by my own
Just in case my faith go, I'll live by my own law
I'll live by my own law, I'll live by my own
<eos>
>>>Pride Kendrick Lamar
<sos>
Love's gonna get you killed
But pride’s gonna be the death of you and you and me
And you and you and you and me
And you and you and you and me and—
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
I care, I care
Hell-raising, wheel-chasing, new worldly possessions
Flesh-making, spirit-breaking, which one would you lessen?
The better part, the human heart, you love ’em or dissect 'em
Happiness or flashiness? How do you serve the question?
See, in a perfect world, I would be perfect, world
I don't trust people enough beyond they surface, world
I don't love people enough to put my faith in man
I put my faith in these lyrics, hoping I make a band
I understand I ain't perfect, I probably won't come around
This time I might put you down
Last time I ain't give a fuck, I still feel the same now
My feelings might go numb, you're dealing with cold thumb
I’m willing to give up a leg and arm to show empathy from
Pity parties and functions of you and yours
A perfect world, you probably live another 24
I can’t fake humble just 'cause your ass is insecure
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
I care, I care
Maybe I wasn’t there 
Maybe I wasn't there 
Maybe I wasn't there
Now, in a perfect world, I probably won't be insensitive
Cold as December but never remember what winter did
I wouldn't blame you for mistakes I made or the bed I laid
Seems like I point the finger just to make a point nowadays
Smiles and cold stares, the temperature goes there
Indigenous disposition, feel like we belong here
I know the walls, they can listen, I wish they could talk back
The hurt becomes repetition, the love almost lost that
Sick venom in men and women overcome with pride
A perfect world is never perfect, only filled with lies
Promises are broken and more resentment come alive
Race barriers make inferior of you and I
See, in a perfect world, I'll choose faith over riches
I'll choose work over bitches, I'll make schools out of prison
I'll take all the religions and put 'em all in one service
Just to tell 'em we ain't shit, but He's been perfect, world
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
In another life, I surely was there
Me, I wasn't taught to share, but care
I care, I care
Maybe I wasn't there 
Maybe I wasn't there 
Maybe I wasn't there

Bad bitch, pardon me, I say, "What's up?"
Educated, so I put her in the cut
I need a girlfriend
Two hoes and I think I did too much
I got two phones and I don't know who to trust
I need a girlfriend
Bet that girl get lonely, introduce her to my humor
It's a lot of bitches that they sent home in their Uber
Uh, high-profile niggas in my circle dodgin' rumors
I been tucked away, dodgin' blood-suckin' maneuvers
Huh, okay, just say you not ready
Okay, okay, comin' in heavy
Okay, they ain't in shape, I'm petty
Okay, y'all be on E, unleaded
Okay, okay, hold the confetti
Okay, okay, just say you not ready
They wanna bite the hand that try to feed them, prudes
You cannot hidе behind the shades, I see right through it
You ain't stand up on your word, thеn you's a fool
They're not, chea, they're not, chea, they're not bool
I be wanna see me whole gang on TV, pg my Rollie
Turnin' out tops and the tall bitches, that remind me of the old days
Sneakin' in hoes with the backstage pass
What they all in, huh, for the poet? Huh
I'm a young poetic nigga, I just go at it, nigga, I'm a ho at it, nigga
You could ask my mama, we poetic, nigga
I was raised in the projects, we could go at it, nigga
I can't waste no time on a co-edded, nigga
Bro code, me and Dad count through seven figures
Raised around bottles and dope fiends
On a high seat since the day I turned sixteen
747, I'm starin' at plane wings
Prayin' the Lord's seen, Grandma prayin' for me 
Huh, okay, just say you not ready
Okay, okay, comin' in heavy
Okay, they ain't in shape, I'm petty
Okay, y'all be on E, unleaded
Okay, okay, hold the confetti
Okay, okay, just say you not ready
They wanna bite the hand that try to feed them, prudes
You cannot hide behind the shades, I see right through it
You ain't stand up on your word, then you's a fool
They're not, chea, they're not, chea, they're not bool
Everybody wanna be great, but the work don't relate him to life
Be mistakin' the truth, nigga
I remember bankin' with Chase, like four-hundred K
Starin' at it, I ain't know what to do, nigga
Now I look at money like a resource
Every contract gotta put my kid's family in school
Health and wealth, goin' deep for it, do right for my next life
Let me get some too
I remember roaches, mama lost focus
I was at home, no lights, no food
Heard that the joke is "Hykeem broke"
And head to the ground when I walk in school
Goin' through the motions, mad impulsive
Granny, I won't abide by the rules
I shall reside with advisers to boom
Fuck that, Booman, let me get some too
Life ain't always about your name in they mouth
And the cars and the clothes and the jewels 
Every lil' bitch that's born looking like soft porn
Only meant for your ego to bruise 
Bet when the hoes get bored and the points ain't score
You gon' live in this world confused 
Every day, the hate restored and the faith get short
Fuck that, let me get some too
Nigga, my livelihood was understood
That the roof I'm in not bool
Nigga, the shoes I fill are huge
"Keem, wanna share that ho?" Bro, move
Nigga wanna fake sneak diss
'Cause I fucked his bitch in a black hatchback
I front in the pics when the heart don't match
Take care of the kids, gotta go where they at, ayy
Hold on, let's get this shit, let's get this shit
Let's get this shit, let's, hmm
Top of the mornin', top of the mornin', top of the mornin'
Top of the mornin', top of the mornin'
Hold on, let's get this shit, let's get this shit
Let's get this shit, let's, hmm 
Ain't shit changed, still fuckin' and rappin'
Two bad bitches here, Cartier glasses, huh
Her friend got pornography habits 
Rollie gang, Rollie gang, Rollie gang 
Hundred thousand on her, she know she gang 
Rover gang, Rover gang, Rover gang 
Range brothers out the roof, we're not the Wayans 
Bitch, I hate to tell the truth, we're not the same 
I'm with my Rover brother and we're runnin' game 
Whippin' rubber bands on the meatloaf
Overseas, tidy up for me 'fore I get home
Take one, take two, take three, heave it
Stop hidin' comments under your sleeve, nigga, believe it
Why your boyfriend keep on lookin' for me, is he Jesus?
Let's get this shit, let's get this shit
Let's get this shit, let's, hmm
Top of the mornin', top of the mornin', top of the mornin'
Top of the mornin', top of the mornin'
Hold on, let's get this shit, let's get this shit
Let's get this shit, let's, hmm

>>>Really Doe Kendrick Lamar
<sos>
You niggas don’t even know
All that talk then no show
Cannot tell me nothin'
Show me somethin' I ain't seen before
That hoe want my piccolo
Smoking on that mistletoe
Make her kiss all on it
While we chop chop on them 24s
She look like a centerfold
Mouth all on my genitals
Suckin' on it like she gettin' vitamins and minerals
I be on the chemicals, she be on my testicles
Poke her with my tentacle then put her out my schedules
Rolling up them vegetables
Rapping with that special flow
Only way you're next to blow if you be strapped with C4
I be fresh from head to toe, every day a fashion show
Used to tote that Calico and serve like John McEnroe
Now I sell out all my shows
Used to sell out all my blow
That was back when we was coppin' dubs to try and roll up 4
Now a nigga livin' good
I done made it out the hood
Think I'm goin' back?
I wish a motherfucker would
Yeah, they say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
Really doe, like really doe
They say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
Really doe, like really doe
Still wicked as Aleister, Crowley niggas know me well
For heaven's sake, I'm the GOAT, you haters can go to hell
When you're getting money, nigga, every day is sunny
I'ma act an ass on that donkey, let her pull my ponytail
Second grade, took my mama weddin' ring, took that bitch
To show-and-tell, now I'm married to the game to no avail
Grounded me for like a month, now I'm gettin' high as fuck
Employer tryna write me up, but now I'm a writer
With ambitions of a rider, and half the shit on my rider I don't even want, the Fanta's for us, the Henny's for the sluts 
Givenchy bikers with the rev rips
Balmain badmon, Bathing Ape on my dick
Paid by the Bloods, raised by the Crips
Soulo Ho3 the prophecies, atrocities, exhibition
Oh yeah, now a nigga livin' good
But good could be better I wish a motherfucker would
Yeah, they say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
Really doe, like really doe
They say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
Really doe, like really doe
Life is like an appetite of truth and dare, I double dare ya
Life to end in vain before the end is near
See I can hear you crying
Silence sittin' in the dark
Holdin' crosses 'cross your heart
Sin is such a work of art
Watch out for the love lost
Bet a thousand, shoot a thousand
Things a nigga do for thousands
Made a million counting sheep
Gave it all to public housin'
Taking off to Abu Dhabi
Beamin' up the motor, Scotty
Talking to promoters, Scotty
Everybody know it's Gotti
Murder one, you've heard of them
The rev undid, the all day madness
Got it off the wipe it off, the evidence, the blood on mattress
Big power, big stages
My zoo cannot fit the cages
This booth is not used to fakin'
My crew just love confrontation
I chewed the face off the laces
I moved the weight from the waitress
I chef the pot that made poison
I cooked then kicked all the patients
My bitch is way beyond basic
That's life insurance, car insurance, good pussy insurance
Ayy, look what we're enduring
Ayy, ridin' in foreigns
Ayy, K-Dot, four years, I got the same watch
But it's the real watch and that bitch fire
Speed Racer waitin' outside
The roof on it like a tank top
Countin' money, watchin' paint dry
When I'm done is when the rain stops, uh
They say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
Really doe, like really doe
They say I got the city on fire
I ain't boomin', that's a goddamn lie, woah
Really doe, like really doe
I wish you motherfuckin' would
Listen, wish a motherfucker would, Brown
I had to put my foot down
It's like I'm popping a clutch
Your hate palpable, your jaw full of dust
You gon' keep talkin' or are we lockin' it up?
And I'm the type of nigga it ain't never been an honor to judge
You a mouse that the falcon picked up
So disrespect will get you checked like the top of the month
I was a liar as a kid so now I'm honest as fuck
And I never pass my mama no blunt
And kept my head straight
Listen deadweight never been a problem to dunk
Look, I just broke up with my bitch cause we ain't argue enough
I keep it dirty as a spliff my uncle Alchemist puff
I strike a birdie on 'em, while I hit your mouth with the club
I wake up early on 'em, gettin' out the house is a must
It's like a sweaty pit, sweaty sick, countin' your dubs
Either that or you gon' catch me on a mountain with monks
Loungin', ask your girl why her mouth on my nuts
You've been the same motherfucker since 2001
Well it's the left-handed shooter, Kyle Lowry the pump
I'm at your house like, "Why you got your couch on my Chucks?"
>>>Sidewalks Kendrick Lamar
<sos>
Uh, uh, uh, uh-uh, uh, yeah, like
I ran out of tears when I was eighteen
So nobody made me but the main streets
'Cause too many people think they made me
Well, if they really made me, then replace me
Homeless to Forbes List, these niggas bring no stress
I feel like Moses, I feel like I'm chosen
And if you ain't my nigga, then your girl single to me
I don't give a damn if a nigga said he knew me
Grew up with no father so nobody ever "son" me
My flow too sick, Kevin Costner couldn't touch me
I know you wish that nobody ever love me
I feel useless when I'm never makin' money, ah
Well, this the life we always fantasized
Rich folk problem through a Queen Street nigga's eyes
Every time you see me pullin' up in Aventadors
Just know we been grindin' on them sidewalks
Sidewalks saved my life
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life
They show me all the signs
They don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they lead me on
I come from murder one, brung late night melee
We hung all summer, sprung mattress with bae bae
Trippin' off Dyke and my name strike with pay day
Flippin' blue lightnin', tightenin', strapped with AK
OG one, told me one, show me one, eight ways
Pussy, power, profit and headache
I reminisce my life innocence or life innocent
Or life intimate, with fame
Light limo tint with light women, dark women in it
Aw, Kenny, good game
She wanna hang with a Starboy
The sun and the moon and star, boy
I line 'em up, we grind 'em up, there's nine of us
And five of us have probably fucked
She mollied up, I tallied up all the parts, boy
Twenty legs, arms, head 
Head, head, more head 
Oh God, bless the dead 
I'm livin' life, high off life
I wear my chokes off to bed
I'm the greatest nigga, why you scared to say it?
I wanna rock, I wanna rock
I wanna cop more land, I never stop
I wanna quick advance on a bill if it ain't one
Break everything, I'm a hustler, came from
Sidewalks saved my life 
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life 
They show me all the signs
They don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they lead me on

I ran my whole conglomerate, I was just mappin' shit out in the cubicle
Suicide coupe was a funeral, Trackhawk launch like a slingshot
Big ol' ruby diamond on my pinky finger, that bitch look like a Ring Pop
Money on my mind, money on your head
Can't ride three times while you comin' through the 'jects
Red Cross kept a nigga fed
In the studio with K. Dot fresh out the feds
Yeah, you niggas can't stand the rain, you niggas don't stand a chance
Yeah, Chevrolet candy paint, I spin the bend in the Benz

Five percent tint on the whip like, "Who was that?"
Coupe take off like it's mad
Beat the dope with a fork, I'm whippin' up Sudafed, I'm doin' scams in the lab
Every Thursday, girl's day, spendin' time with my daughter, make me go harder
Every Sunday's son's day, teach my boy to be a man, I ain't had no father
Fell in the love with the block, I ain't have no pop, just a sawed-off shotgun, Mossberg
We stackin' that money up proper, awkward diamonds, look like marbles

>>>Sing About Me, I'm Dying of Thirst Kendrick Lamar
<sos>
When the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
I woke up this morning and figured I'd call you
In case I'm not here tomorrow
I'm hopin' that I can borrow
A peace of mind, I'm behind on what's really important
My mind is really distorted
I find nothing but trouble in my life
I'm fortunate you believe in a dream
This orphanage we call a ghetto is quite a routine
And last night was just another distraction
Or a reaction of what we consider madness
I know exactly what happened
You ran outside when you heard my brother cry for help
Held him like a newborn baby and made him feel
Like everything was alright in a fight he tried to put up
But the type of bullet that stuck
Had went against his will, that's blood spilled on your hands
My plan's rather vindictive
Everybody's a victim in my eyes
When I ride it's a murderous rhythm
And outside became pitch black
A demon glued to my back, whispering "Get 'em!"
I got 'em and I ain't give a fuck
That same mentality I told my brother not to duck
In actuality it's a trip how we trip off of colors
I wonder if I'll ever discover a passion like you and recover
The life that I knew as a youngin
In pajamas and dun-ta-duns
When thunder comes it rains cats and dogs dumb
Niggas like me never prosper
Prognosis of a problem child, I'm proud and well-devoted
This Piru shit been in me forever
So forever I'ma push it, wherever, whenever
And I love you 'cause you love my brother like you did
Just promise me you'll tell this story when you make it big
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
You wrote a song about my sister on your tape
And called it Section.80
The message resembled "Brenda's Got a Baby"
What's crazy was I was hearin' about it
But doubted your ignorance
How could you ever just put her on blast and shit?
Judgin' her past and shit?
Well, it's completely my future
Her nigga behind me right now askin' for ass and shit
And I'ma need that forty dollars
Even if I got to fuck, suck and swallow
In the parking lot, Gonzales Park, I'm followed
By a married man, and father of three
My titties bounce on the cadence of his tinklin' keys
Matter of fact, he my favorite 'cause he tip me with E's
He got a cousin named David and I seen him last week
This is the life of another girl damaged by the system
These foster homes, I run away and never do miss 'em
See, my hormones just run away and if I can get 'em
Back to where they used to be, then I'll probably be in the denim
Of a family gene that show women how to be woman
Or better yet, a leader, you need her to learn somethin'
Then you probably need to beat her, that's how I was taught
Three niggas in one room, first time I was tossed
And I'm exhausted, but fuck that "Sorry for your loss" shit
My sister died in vain, but what point are you tryna gain
If you can't fit the pumps I walk in?
I'll wait… Your rebuttal a little too late
And if you have a album date, just make sure I'm not in the song
'Cause I don't need the attention, bring enough of that on my own
And matter fact, did I mention that I physically feel great?
A doctor's approval is a waste of time, I know I'm straight
I'll probably live longer than you and never fade away
I'll never fade away, I'll never fade away, I know my fate
And I'm on the grind for this cake, I'ma get it or die tryin'
I'm eyein' every male gender with intentions of buyin'
You lyin' to these motherfuckers
Talkin' about you can help 'em with my story
You can help me if you sell this pussy for me, nigga
Don't ignore me, nigga, fuck your glory, nigga, you ain't shit…
When the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Sometimes I look in the mirror
And ask myself: Am I really scared of passin' away?
If it's today, I hope I hear a
Cry out from Heaven so loud it can water down a demon
With the Holy Ghost 'til it drown in the blood of Jesus
I wrote some raps that made sure that my lifeline reekin'
The scent of a reaper, ensurin' that my allegiance
With the other side may come soon, and if I'm doomed
May the womb of my mother be blessed for many moons
I suffer a lot
And every day that glass mirror get tougher to watch
I tie my stomach in knots
And I'm not sure why I'm infatuated with death
My imagination is surely an aggravation of threats
That can come about, 'cause the tongue is mighty powerful
And I can name a list of your favorites that probably vouch
Maybe 'cause I'm a dreamer and sleep is the cousin of death
Really stuck in the schema of wonderin' when I'ma rest
And you're right, your brother was a brother to me
And your sister's situation was the one that pulled me
In a direction to speak on somethin'
That's realer than the TV screen
By any means, wasn't tryin' to offend or come between
Her personal life, I was like "It need to be told"
Cursin' the life of twenty generations after her soul
Exactly what'd happen if I ain't continue rappin'
Or steady bein' distracted by money, drugs and 4-5's
I count lives, all on these songs
Look at the weak and cry, pray one day you'll be strong
Fightin' for your rights, even when you're wrong
And hope that at least one of you sing about me when I'm gone
Am I worth it? Did I put enough work in?
Promise that you will sing about me
I said when the lights shut off and it's my turn
To settle down, my main concern
Promise that you will sing about me
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
Promise that you'll sing about me forever
Promise that you'll sing about me for— ooooh
"Ay, ay, ay, where you 'bout to go?"
"Nigga, the homie's brother—nigga, right here, he gone, my nigga, he gone!"
"Hey, come to the store for a nigga, one time."
"We on the block right now, my nigga, like, we—nigga, we right here, my nigga."
"Bring a nigga back a black!"
"Nigga—bruh—nigga, they just killed the homie's brother, my nigga. We right here on the block, my nigga... Al—alright, nigga—nigga, just come—alright, alright, just call me back, man, just call me back."
"Bring a nigga back a black!"
"Ahh, fuck... So, so, what we gon' do, my niggas? What we gon' do?"
"Bro, we can go back right now, my nigga. Like... nigga, I don't give a fuck, my nigga. We can go back right now."
"Fuck! I'm tired of this shit! I'm tired of fuckin' runnin', I'm tired of this shit! My brother, homie!"
Tired of runnin', tired of huntin'
My own kind, but retirin' nothin'
Tires are steady screechin', the driver is rubbin'
Hands on the wheel, who said we wasn't
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst?
Dope on the corner, look at the coroner
Daughter is dead, mother is mournin' her
Stray bullets, AK bullets
Resuscitation was waitin' patiently, but they couldn't
Bring her back, who got the footage?
Channel 9, cameras is lookin'
It's hard to channel your energy when you know he crooked
Banana clip, split his banana pudding
I'm like Tre, that's Cuba Gooding
I know I'm good at
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst
How many sins? I'm runnin' out
How many sins? I lost count
Dreams of ballin' like Spalding
But only shotty bounce
The reaper callin', I'm cottonmouth
Money is power 
Yours is ours 
Lay with a snitch, die with a coward
Hope we get rich, hope we can tower
Over the city with vanity with the music louder
The same song, a black flower
I'll show you how to
Dye your thirst, dye your thirst, dye your thirst
What are we doin'? Who are we foolin'?
Hell is hot, fire is proven
To burn for eternity, return of the student
That never learned how to live righteous but how to shoot it
Tired of runnin', choirs is hummin'
Tell us to visit, we lie about comin'
Now back to business, loadin' the guns in
Back of the Buick, your hood is feudin'
The beef is bubblin', it's no discussion
Hereditary, all of my cousins
Dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst, dyin' of thirst
Too many sins, I'm runnin' out
Somebody send me a well for the drought
See all I know is takin' notes
On takin' this life for granted, granted, if he provoke
My best days, I stress days
Say "fuck the world," my sex slave
Money, pussy, and greed—what's my next crave?
Whatever it is, know it's my next grave
Tired of runnin', tired of runnin', tired of tumblin'
Tired of runnin', tired of tumblin', backwards
My momma say "See, a pastor give me a promise
What if today was the rapture and you completely tarnished?
The truth will set you free, so to me be completely honest
You dyin' of thirst, you dyin' of thirst
So hop in that water, and pray that it works"
Fuck! I'm tired of this shit!
I'm tired of fuckin' runnin', I'm tired of this shit!
That’s my brother, homie!
Young man, come talk to me! Is that what I think that is?
I know that's not what I think that is
Why are you so angry?
See, you young men are dying of thirst
Do you know what that means?
That means you need water, holy water
You need to be baptized, with the spirit of the Lord
Do you want to receive God as your personal savior?
Okay, repeat after me:
"Lord God, I come to You a sinner"
"And I humbly repent for my sins"
"I believe that Jesus is Lord"
"I believe You raised Him from the dead"
"I would ask that Jesus come into my life"
"And be my Lord and Savior"
"I receive Jesus to take control of my life"
"And that I may live for Him from this day forward"
"Thank you, Lord Jesus
For saving me with Your precious blood"
(Thank you, Lord Jesus
For saving me with Your precious blood)
"In Jesus' name, amen"
Alright now, remember this day
The start of a new life, your REAL life
<eos>
>>>These Walls Kendrick Lamar
<sos>
I remember you was conflicted, misusing your influence
Sometimes, I did the same
If these walls could talk
If these walls could talk—
She just want to close her eyes and sway
With you, with you, with you 
Exercise her right to work it out
It's true, it's true, it's true
Shout out to the birthday girls
Say hey , say hey , 
Everyone deserves a night to play 
She plays, only when you tell her no
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I'm in it, I love it when I'm in it
If these walls could talk, they'd tell me to swim good
No boat, I float better than he would
No life jacket, I'm not the God of Nazareth
But your flood can be misunderstood
Walls telling me they full of pain, resentment
Need someone to live in them just to relieve tension
Me, I'm just a tenant
Landlord said these walls vacant more than a minute
These walls are vulnerable, exclamation
Interior pink, color coordinated
I interrogated every nook and cranny
I mean, it's still amazing, before they couldn't stand me
These walls want to cry tears
These walls happier when I'm here
These walls never could hold up
Every time I come around, demolition might crush
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I'm in it, I love it when I'm in it
If these walls could talk, they'd tell me to go deep
Yelling at me continuously, I can see
Your defense mechanism is my decision
Knock these walls down, that's my religion
Walls feeling like they ready to close in
I suffocate, then catch my second wind
I resonate in these walls
I don't know how long I can wait in these walls
I've been on the streets too long
Looking at you from the outside in
They sing the same old song
About how they walls always the cleanest
I beg to differ, I must've missed them
I'm not involved, I'd rather diss 'em
I'd rather call on you, put your wall up
'Cause when I come around, demolition gon' crush
If these walls could talk
I can feel your reign when it cries, gold lives inside of you
If these walls could talk
I love it when I'm in it, I love it when I'm in it
If your walls could talk, they'd tell you it's too late
Your destiny accepted your fate
Burn accessories and stash them on the yard
Take the recipe, the Bible and God
Wall telling you that commissary is low
Race wars happening, no calling CO
No calling your mother to save you
Homies to say you're irrepetible, not acceptable
Your behavior is Sammy the Bull like
A killer that turned snitch
Walls is telling me you a bitch
You pray for appeals hoping the warden would afford them
That sentence so important
Walls telling you to listen to "Sing About Me"
Retaliation is strong, you even dream 'bout me
Killed my homeboy and God spared your life
Dumb criminal got indicted same night
So when you play this song, rewind the first verse
About me abusing my power so you can hurt
About me and her in the shower whenever she horny
About me and her in the after hours of the morning
About her baby daddy currently serving life
And how she think about you until we meet up at night
About the only girl that cared about you when you asked her
And how she fuckin' on a famous rapper
Walls can talk 
I remember you was conflicted
Sometimes I did the same
Abusing my power, full of resentment
Resentment that turned into a deep depression
Found myself screaming in a hotel room
<eos>

I been feelin' kinda cooped up, cooped up

Hey, why you got the roof off, roof off?

You ain’t gotta draw no extra attention
Paparazzi wanna shoot ya, shoot ya
Niggas dyin' for less out here

One hunnid thou' on the passenger
Bitch, I'm Kendrick Lamar, respect me from afar

Everybody in attendance, I'm about to perform
Everybody get offended by the shit I got on
Like, can you buy that, nigga?
Nine hundred horse, can you drive that, nigga?
A G5, can you fly that, nigga?
I need tints so I can look at the snakes and posers
 'Cause bomb head is non-disclosure
 So I can live with a peace of mind
Without niggas takin' a piece of mine
And peace be still and not do fines, so fuck a fix-it ticket
You pull me over and might see one of your bitches, ahh!
Ridin' round and round that open strip
I need tints 
I need tints 
I can't be flying down that 110 with a bad bitch in my whip
I need tints 
I need tints 
And it's no good for me, it's so good for them
I need tints

I got way too much to lose, so roll your window up real quick

You know I like it presidential 
Stretch it out, that's a limo 
Pull it over, let me get behind ya 
Where we goin', they don't need to know 
Ghost ridin' in the Phantom 
Niggas never see me comin' 
She wanna hold me like a ransom 
But the money keep me runnin' 
I been in my bag, adding weight
Tryna throw a bag in a safe
Giggin', tourin', chorin', raisin' babes

I'm sick and tired of being tired
Can't pick a side, the Gemini

Promise momma not to fear nobody
Seen black turn 'em Burgundy
Hundred of them, I know I'm greedy
Stuck inside the belly of the beast
Can you please pray for me?
Get God on the phone
Said it won't be long
I see jigaboos, I see Styrofoams
My hood going brazy
Where did we go wrong?
I see jigaboos, I see Styrofoams
Get Top on the phone
Tell the squad come home
We gon' ball again 'fore he call us home
World is going brazy, where did we go wrong?
It's a tidal wave, it's a thunderdome
Get God on the phone
I just got a raise 
Spent it all on me 
Diamonds all appraised 
And I'm bossing up 
Bitch, get out the way 
I'm the only way, we can fornicate
Ah, pimping and posing, look what I drove in, ah
Having these hoes and I know that I'm chosen, ah
I live by the code and me and my bros and, ah
My dollars ain't foldin', you was never the homie
Seen black turn 'em Burgundy

Stuck inside the belly of the beast

Cornrow Kenny, he was born with a vision
All morning with the mixed dashboards, triple digits
Parallel park like an alien came visit
Slideshow for the night show, ten bitches
Find hoes with a blindfold, King Kendrick
So many plays, homie, I finesse
Palisade views with some sex
I lost a lot of love for missionary
This the first time I confess
Me and Top is like a Kobe and Phil
A father figure fuck with him, you get killed
Fuck with me and he will kill you himself
TDE the mafia of the west
Move in silence, yeah, we juggin’ like that
Act of violence, yeah, we juggin’ like that
I did a lot of dumb shit in my past
Lord forgive me, hoping I don't relapse
Dave just bought a new 911
Almost thought I’d seen another plane crash
Q just bought a brand new McLaren
Rock-a-lack about to buy the projects
Moosa got his son dripping in gold
Ali 'bout to let his hair down on hoes
Me, I'm 'bout to let my hair down on hoes
Top billin', that’s a million a show
Might blow the whole no whammy on Soul
Might tell Obama be more like Punch
Sounwave caught a Grammy last year
Mack wop, bet he do what he want
Fuck you niggas, level two, I'm not done
2Teez told me that I'm the one
I can put a rapper on life support
Guarantee that's something none of you want
Ten homies down and they all serving life
What is like twenty-five hundred a month?
What if I empty my bank out and stunt?
What if I certified all of these ones?
Bitch, I get buck, I'm as real as they come
Shit is amazing, I'm feeding my cravings
You know that you want me, come here now, lil' baby
I'm fuckin', I'm crazy
Serving it like I belong in the basement
Or live at the Days Inn
Yan Yan my relative, black cherry soda

Yep, all day, "Mortal Man" and "Kunta"
Alright, from the top

So I met this young lady, ya know, when I went back home. I was tryna spit my best game to her, you know, give her my best cap, but she kept on snapping her fingers like *snaps*. I said "You know what, girl? You crazy." Then she asked me what he said...
 "A peace of mind"
That's what the Asian said—I need a divine
Intervention was his religion and I was surprised
Him believing in Buddha, me believing in God
Asked him what are you doing, he said "taking my time
Meditation is a must, it don't hurt if you try
See you thinking too much, plus you too full of yourself
Worried about your career, you ever think of your health?"
 "A piece of land"
That's what the Indian said—I needed the man
Telling me longevity is in the dirt
Should buy some property first
Should profit a better dollar with generational perks
Equity at his best, really, you should invest
These tangible things expire, don't you expect
Income with so much outcome and yes
Look at my heritage, we blessed
 "A piece of pussy"
That's what the black man said I needed to push me
To the limit, to satisfy my hunger
We do it all for a woman from haircut to a war
We like to live in the jungle, like to play in the peach
What you saying to me?
He said "nigga, come back to reality for a week"
Pussy is power, fuck on a new bitch every night
I wouldn't be prouder, you should allow it
 A piece of mine's
That's what the white man wanted when I rhyme
Telling me that he selling me just for $10.99
If I go platinum from rapping, I do the company fine
What if I compromise? He said it don't even matter
You make a million or more, you living better than average
You losing your core following, gaining it all
He put a price on my talent, I hit the bank and withdraw
Hit the bank and withdraw, hit the bank and withdraw
Put myself in the rocket ship and I shot for the stars
"Look at what you accomplishing"; what he said to the boy
"I'ma make you some promises that you just can't ignore
Your profession anonymous as an artist if I don't target your market
If you ain't signing your signature when I throw you my wallet
A lot of rappers are giving their demo all in the toilet
Your world tour, your master's, mortgage, I need a piece"
I holler, "What you do? What you say?"
I shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if I get freed today
I holler, "What you do? What you say?"
I shall enjoy the fruits of my labor if I get freed today
What the black man say?
Tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die
Tell 'em we don't die, we multiply
Tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die
Tell 'em we don't die, we multiply
Tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die
Tell 'em we don't die, we multiply
Tell 'em we don't die, tell 'em we don't die
Tell 'em we don't die, we multiply

I feel like Pacino in Godfather, I'm charged
Our Father who art in Heaven, Kendrick at large
Came in the game with a plan of beatin' the odds
What an accomplishment, broken promises
Kept my focus anonymous till I dealt with the consequence
The greatest, the latest mogul, you know what time it is
You niggas fear me like y'all fear God
You sound frantic, I hear panic in your voice
Just know the mechanics of making your choice in writin' your bars
Before you poke out your chest, loosen your bra
Before you step out of line and dance with the star
I could never end a career if it never start
The murderous capital, avenues lookin' like evil dead zombies
With batteries to the head
The flattery of watchin' my stock rise
The salary, the compensation tripled my cock size
I run through these stop signs with no brake fluid
Just premium gas, do it for dolo
Crash markets and prejudiced tags, look at my photo
Black excellence, pessimist, die countin' my coin
Hope it's evident that I inspired a thousand emcees to do better
I blew cheddar on youth centers, buildings and beamers and blue leather
Forecastin' my future, this is the future
The mastermind, until my next album, more power to you
Come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on , come on
Come on, come on, come on, come on

We're just jammin' out, we on stage
Taz, we just jammin' out 
Hundred thousand 
Hundred thousand, you gotta see it!
Look, look, look, go back to the down note
They all sing this shit, everybody
Now I don't let you down, down for
You see, you see, you see, you see 
But I don't shake you down, dog for you, you, you, you, uh
They say the government ain't the truth, truth,  truth, truth
And the politicians always mislead the youth, youth, youth, youth
But head is the answer
Head is the future
Don't second guess yourself
Come on, give me some help
Hey one more time, band, I need y'all to help me out right now 
Head is the answer 
Head is the futu—it's the future, that nigga said
Don't second guess yourself 
Come on, give me some help
Say come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
Come on, come on—my background singer—come on, come on 
Say, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on

Great, the—the ho's screaming now, uh 
I said baby you make
You make me wanna just, ah!
Baby,  you got me speechless right now
I gotta take it there, I ain't even playin' no more
Uh, said you just make me wanna drag you down

Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey
Two tears in the bucket I cry with you, uh
But I could never lie with you
I could never afford not to afford
I could never put my plans to the side with you
I could never see a red light
Like a deer with a headlight
I freeze up when I re-up
See I barely have patience
Only the moment to complete us
Why you hate to work for it?
The reason I never went to work for it
See a nine to five was so jive turkey
But when Thanksgiving came that check didn’t hurt me
You plead the fifth
I read the Fifth Amendment
We both criminals with bad intentions
They say time heals all
But if I can shortcut
My success, Corvettes by tomorrow
Now, why you so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey
My home girl got a credit card scam
She got a scholarship to college but she don’t give a damn
Intuition got a broke bitch wishin'
She tell me this on the phone with the noodles in the pan
I know you, woman, I console you, woman
You feel like the universe owes you, woman
Oh the anticipation, of hoping you could make it
Bitches don't prosper chasing education
But you're talented, and can't handle it
And your homegirls can't be your manager
365 times four, plus more
If you can't get it right, tell me, do you got the stamina?
But shit, ain't no money like fast money
Even today I'm considered a crash dummy
A rapper chasing stardom, how can I fast forward?
My accolades better than all them
Why you so sad?
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey
I wrote this song looking at a broke home baby 
You know the poverty stricken the little broke born babies 
Somebody yell "Kendrick American, they sho’ is crazy"
And I said “why?”
Then he looked me in the eye, and said "nigga you fucked up"
You’re banking on good luck, you wishing for miracles
You never been through shit, you’re crying hysterical
You settle for everything, complain about everything
You say you sold crack, my world amphetamine
Your projects ain’t shit, I live in a hut bitch
I'm living to keep warm, you living to pay rent
I prayed my way through by waiting on Allah
You played your way through, by living in sci-fi
Bullshitting yourself, you talking to strangers
Same thing goes for the ones you came with
When y'all came on the boat looking for hope
And all you can say is that you’re looking for dope
These days ain’t no compromise
And your pain ain’t mines half the time
A brand new excuse ain’t shit to me
Bitch, I made my moves, with shackled feet
In today's day and age we practice the self pity of taking the easy way out
You wait on them, him and her
But when a blessing takes too long, that's when you go wrong
Walking around with them blue faces
She said I’m down on my luck
And it’s something I gotta have
I hit the bank today and told them color me bad
Get that new money, and it’s breaking me down honey

They don't do it how we do
Niggas ain't on the shit we on 
Spikes on the Louboutins 
I'm 'round the bullshit like a matador
I'm used to the bullshit, it don't matter boy
Corporate acquisitions, accumulations of wealth
Build with the gods and double knowledge of self
Entrepreneur visions, Moulin Rouge religion
That pussy make a weak nigga break down
So what you want, the cheese or the cheeks?
You want the cheeks but she want the cheese, a bitch gotta eat
I'm havin' the epiphany, you niggas ain't shit to me
Worse than the scum in the slum I'm from
I'm a Southside nigga, yeah, I'm 'bout mine
You be that next nigga coroners come outline
You ain't made of what I'm made of
You a bum nigga with a bum bitch, her shoes come from Bakers
You counterfeit, fraudulent fakers
What kind of rich nigga bitch look like that?
We on now; we pullin' off the lot
Brake, hit the button, then we pulling down the top
Shine's on, stuntin', and I'm pullin' out a knot
Strapped with the Glock, won't pull it out a lot
But front, I'll make it pop
Y'all don't do it how we do
Niggas ain't on the shit we on 
Spikes on the Louboutins 
Visualize everything I needed and dream 
Penalized every ho nigga that had a scheme 
Guns in your video get you locked in the bing
Yeah, I kill a nigga quick, no worries, my record clean
Murder one become manslaughter as soon as they brought up 
Charity work, parking tickets and no charges 
Fuck nigga you fucked over your father
When he gave you a dick
Should have been a bitch in pajamas
I made my first million fucking dollars
Bought a Bible, oh yeah, God got me
Made my second million dollars, bought a chopper and binocular
I'm scared, this shit don't happen to everybody
I'm on Instagram looking at your favorite singer
Debating on should I fuck or jump on her single
20 thou, she got a hell of a adlib
I'm in her mouth like I knew I could have kids, K-Dot
We on now; we pullin' off the lot
Brake, hit the button, then we pulling down the top
Shine's on, stuntin', and I'm pullin' out a knot
Strapped with the Glock, won't pull it out a lot
But front, I'll make it pop
Y'all don't do it how we do
Niggas ain't on the shit we on 
Spikes on the Louboutins 
Good pussy for dinner, b-bomb kush for breakfast
D colored VS stones around my neck, bitch
It feels like a nigga dreamin'
Seat back, music bumpin', niggas leanin'
Bullseye, that's what we came for
The bread, now a nigga run the game, boy
I should've sent the broad to report what's in the yard
Aloof livin', I came up so hard
No pain, no gain, it's embedded in the brain
I'm in it for the grip, motherfuck the fame
We on now; we pullin' off the lot
Brake, hit the button, then we pulling down the top
Shine's on, stuntin', and I'm pullin' out a knot
Strapped with the Glock, won't pull it out a lot
But front, I'll make it pop
Y'all don't do it how we do
Niggas ain't on the shit we on 
Spikes on the Louboutins 
'Round the world tourin', the city got boring
Bury me a G with a new pair of Jordans
Coupe foreign, top peeled like an orange
Blue Ferrari, so many iron horses
Living life with no worries
My gun got a Zodiac sign, it's a Taurus
Don't make it slam on you like Amar'e
M-Zone Rida Gang end the story
Oops, that's your baby, my bad, I'm sorry
She call me daddy too, we should be on Maury
Everything you aren't, fly nigga soaring
Purple label Ralph Lauren, kick game like Atari
You so special, bedroom or restroom
Just keep performing, go girl
About to film a movie, guess who's starring

New Kung Fu Kenny!
Throw a steak off the ark to a pool full of sharks
Leave him in the wilderness with a sworn nemesis
He'll make it 
Take the gratitude from him, I bet he'll show you somethin'
I chip a nigga lil' bit of nothin'
I chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, "Bitch, I did that!," X-rated
Johnny don't wanna go to school no mo', no mo'
Johnny said books ain't cool no mo' 
Johnny wanna be a rapper like his big cousin
Johnny caught a body yesterday out hustlin'
God bless America, you know we all love him
Yesterday, I got a call, like, from my dawg, like 101
Said they killed his only son because of insufficient funds
He was sobbin', he was mobbin', way belligerent and drunk
Talkin' out his head, philosophin' on what the Lord had done
He said: "K-Dot, can you pray for me? It been a fucked up day for me
I know that you anointed, show me how to overcome."
He was lookin' for some closure, hopin' I could bring him closer
To the spiritual, my spirit do know better, but I told him
"I can't sugarcoat the answer for you, this is how I feel:
If somebody kill my son, that mean somebody gettin' killed."
Tell me what you do for love, loyalty, and passion of
All the memories collected, moments you could never touch
I wait in front a nigga's spot and watch him hit his block
I catch a nigga leavin' service if that's all I got
I chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Walk myself to the court like, "Bitch, I did that!"
Ain't no Black Power when your baby killed by a coward
I can't even keep the peace, don't you fuck with one of ours
It be murder in the street, it be bodies in the hour
Ghetto bird be on the street, paramedics on the dial
Let somebody touch my momma, touch my sister, touch my woman
Touch my daddy, touch my niece, touch my nephew, touch my brother
You should chip a nigga, then throw the blower in his lap
Matter fact, I'm 'bout to speak at this convention, call you back—
Alright, kids, we're gonna talk about gun control
 Damn!
It's not a place
This country is to me a sound
Of drum and bass
You close your eyes to look around
Hail Mary, Jesus and Joseph
The great American flag is wrapped in drag with explosives
Compulsive disorder, sons and daughters
Barricaded blocks and borders—look what you taught us
It's murder on my street, your street, back streets, Wall Street
Corporate offices, banks, employees, and bosses with
Homicidal thoughts; Donald Trump's in office
We lost Barack and promised to never doubt him again
But is America honest, or do we bask in sin?
Pass the gin, I mix it with American blood
Then bash him in, you Crippin' or you married to Blood?
I'll aks again—oops, accident
It's nasty when you set us up then roll the dice, then bet us up
You overnight the big rifles, then tell Fox to be scared of us
Gang members or terrorists, et cetera, et cetera
America's reflections of me, that's what a mirror does
It's not a place

Of drum and bass

Today is the day I follow my intuition
Keep the family close, get money, fuck bitches
I double-parked the Aston in the red
My momma told me that I'ma work myself to death
My girl told me don't let these hoes get in my head

See me on the TV and scream: "That's Uncle Kendrick!"
Yeah, that's the business 
Somebody tell Geraldo this nigga got some ambition
I'm not a politician, I'm not 'bout a religion

>>>YOLO Kendrick Lamar
<sos>
YOLO, you only live once
The battle cry of a generation
This life is a precious gift
So don't get too crazy
It's not worth the risk
You know that we are still young
So don't be dumb
'Cause you only live once
Uh, you only live once, that's the motto
So take a chill pill, ease off the throttle 
Never go to loud clubs 'cause it's bad for your ears
Your friends will all be sorry when they can't hear
And stay the hell away from drugs 'cause they not legal
Then bury all your money in the backyard like a beagle
'Cause you should never trust a bank, they've been known to fail
And never travel by car or bus, boat or by rail
And don't travel by plane, and don't travel at all
Build a bomb shelter basement with titanium walls
And wear titanium suits in case pianos fall on you
And never go to saunas 'cause they're crawlin' with piranhas
And never take the stairs 'cause they're often unsafe
You only live once, don't let it go to waste 
You know that we are still young
So hold off on the fun
Cook your meat till it's done
'Cause you only live once
Yeah, and here's another piece of advice
Stay away from kids, 'cause their hair is filled with mad lice
There's no such thing as too much Purell
This a cautionary tale, word to George Orwell
So don't 1980-force any plugs into sockets
Always wear a chastity belt and triple lock it
Then hire a taster, make him check your food for poison
And if you think your mailman is a spy, then destroy him
No blankets or pajamas, they can choke you in your sleep
Two words about furniture: killing machines
Now, board your windows up the sun is bad for your health
And always wear a straitjacket so you're safe from yourself
Uh huh, take no chances, stop freelancin'
Invest in your future, don't dilute your finances
401K, make sure it's low risk
Then get some real estate , 4.2%
Thirty year mortgage, that's important, that's a great deal
And if you can't afford it, don't forge it on your last bill
Renting is for suckers right now
A dependable savings and you'll retire with money in your account
Isolate yourself and just roll solo, be carefulo
You Oughta Look Out also stands for YOLO
You know that we are still young
Burn the prints off your thumbs
Then pull out all your teeth
So you can't bite your tongue
Only on this earth for a short time, time
So don't go outside, cause you don't want to die, die
Just take our advice and hide
And scream YOLO to the sky
You oughta look out

Brown skin and lemon over ice

Come on, Harry, we wanna say goodnight to you
Gravity's holdin' me back
I want you to hold out the palm of your hand
Why don't we leave it at that?
When everything gets in the way
Seems you cannot be replaced
And I'm the one who will stay, oh-oh-oh
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same
"Harry, you're no good alone
Why are you sitting at home on the floor?
What kind of pills are you on?"
And nobody's coming to help
Your daddy lives by himself
He just wants to know that you're well, oh-oh-oh
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
In this world, it's just us
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was
You know it's not the same
Go home, get ahead, light-speed internet
I don't wanna talk about the way that it was
Leave America, two kids follow her
I don't wanna talk about who's doin' it first
You know it's not the same as it was
As it was, as it was

And there's no one to blame but the drink in my wandering hands
It's not what I meant
And I can't take it back, I can't unpack the baggage you left
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
You said you cared, and you missed me too
And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you
And the coffee's out at the Beachwood Cafe
And it kills me 'cause I know we've run out of things we can say
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
And I get the feeling that you'll never need me again
What am I now? What am I now?
What if you're someone I just want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?

I'm hopeless, broken, so you wait for me in the sky
Brown my skin just right
I'm out of my head, and I know that you're scared
Because hearts get broken
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone when it ends
Don't wanna let you know
I don't wanna be alone
But I can feel it take a hold 
I can feel you take control 
Of who I am, and all I've ever known
Lovin' you's the antidote
I don't wanna be alone
I'm out of my head, and I know that you're scared
Because hearts get broken
I know that you're scared because I'm so open
I don't wanna be alone
I'm out of my head, and I know that you're scared
Because hearts get broken

She worked her way through a cheap pack of cigarettes
Hard liquor mixed with a bit of intellect
And all the boys, they were saying they were into it
Such a pretty face on a pretty neck
She's driving me crazy, but I'm into it 
But I'm into it , I'm kinda into it
It's getting crazy, I think I'm losing it 
I think I'm losing it, oh, I think she said
"I'm having your baby"
"It's none of your business"

It's New York, baby, always jacked up 
Holland Tunnel for a nose, it's always backed up
When she's alone, she goes home to a cactus 
In a black dress, she's such an actress
Driving me crazy, but I'm into it 
But I'm into it , I'm kinda into it

Hard candy drippin' on me till my feet are wet
And now she's all over me, it's like I paid for it 
It's like I paid for it, I'm gonna pay for this 
It's none of your, it's none of your—

And you're trying to lift off the ground on those old two wheels
Nothing 'bout the way that you were treated ever seemed especially alarming till now
So you tie up your hair and you smile like it's no big deal
You can let it go
You can throw a party full of everyone you know
And not invite your family 'cause they never showed you love
You don't have to be sorry for leavin' and growin' up, mmm
Matilda, you talk of the pain like it's all alright
But I know that you feel like a piece of you's dead insidе
You showed me a power that is strong еnough to bring sun to the darkest days
It's none of my business, but it's just been on my mind
You can let it go
You can throw a party full of everyone you know
And not invite your family 'cause they never showed you love
You don't have to be sorry for leavin' and growin' up
You can see the world, following the seasons
Anywhere you go, you don't need a reason
'Cause they never showed you love
You don't have to be sorry for doin' it on your own
You're just in time, make your tea and your toast
You framed all your posters and dyed your clothes, ooh
You don't have to go
You don't have to go home
Oh, there's a long way to go
I don't believe that time will change your mind
In other words, I know they won't hurt you anymore
As long as you can let them go
You can let it go
You can throw a party full of everyone you know
You can start a family who will always show you love
You don't have to be sorry for doin' it on your own

Welcome to the final show
I hope you're wearing your best clothes
You can't bribe the door on your way to the sky
You look pretty good down here
But you ain't really good
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets, the bullets?
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from

Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
Just stop your crying, it'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here
Just stop your crying, have the time of your life
Breaking through the atmosphere
Things look pretty good from here
Remember everything will be alright
We can meet again somewhere
Somewhere far away from here
We never learn, we've been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from

It's okay 
It's okay 
Here we go now
Find a place to feel good
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good
All we ever want is automatic all the time
All we ever want is auto all of the time
All we ever want is automatic all the time
All we ever want is auto all of the time
Maybe we can 
Find a place to feel good 
And we can treat people with kindness 
Find a place to feel good

>>>Two Ghosts Harry Styles
<sos>
Same lips red, same eyes blue
Same white shirt, couple more tattoos
But it's not you and it's not me
Tastes so sweet, looks so real
Sounds like something that I used to feel
But I can't touch what I see
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts standing in the place of you and me
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat
The fridge light washes this room white
Moon dances over your good side
This was all we used to need
Tongue-tied like we've never known
Telling those stories we already told
'Cause we don't say what we really mean
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts standing in the place of you and me
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts swimming in a glass half empty
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts standing in the place of you and me
We're not who we used to be
We don't see what we used to see
We're just two ghosts swimming in a glass half empty
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat
I'm just trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat

Tastes like strawberries on a summer evenin'
And it sounds just like a song
I want more berries and that summer feelin'
It's so wonderful and warm
Breathe me in, breathe me out
I don't know if I could ever go without
I'm just thinking out loud
I don't know if I could ever go without
Strawberries on a summer evenin'
Baby, you're the end of June
I want your belly and that summer feelin'
Getting washed away in you
Breathe me in, breathe me out
I don't know if I could ever go without
I just wanna taste it, I just wanna taste it
Tastes like strawberries on a summer evenin'
And it sounds just like a song
I want your belly and that summer feelin'
I don't know if I could ever go without
Watermelon sugar high 
I just wanna taste it, I just wanna taste it 
I just wanna taste it, I just wanna taste it

My Lucifer is lonely
Standing there, killing time
Can't commit to anything but a crime
Peter's on vacation, an open invitation
Pearly Gates look more like a picket fence
Once you get inside 'em
Got friends but can't invite them
Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya
All the good girls go to Hell
'Cause even God herself has enemies
And once the water starts to rise
And Heaven's out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team
My Lucifer is lonely
Look at you needing me
You know I'm not your friend without some greenery
Walk in wearin' fetters
Peter should know better
Your cover up is caving in
Man is such a fool, why are we saving him?
Begging for our help, wow
Hills burn in California
My turn to ignore ya
Don't say I didn't warn ya
All the good girls go to Hell 
'Cause even God herself  has enemies
And once the water starts to rise 
And Heaven's out of sight
She'll want the Devil on her team
My Lucifer is lonely
There's nothing left to save now
My god is gonna owe me
There's nothing left to save now
I cannot do the snowflake

>>>&Burn Billie Eilish

Lips meet teeth and tongue
My heart skips eight beats at once 
If we were meant to be, we would have been by now
See what you wanna see, all I see is him right now
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out
Your love feels so fake
My demands aren't high to make
If I could get to sleep, I would have slept by now 
Your lies will never keep, I think you need to blow them out
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out
I still remember that
Heaven sent a present my way
I won't forget your laugh
Packing everything when you leave
You know you coming back
Wanna see me down on my knees
But that was made for a ring
I try to wait for the storm to calm down
But that's stubborn, baby, leading to war
We droned down on each other
Tryin' to even the score
We all been found guilty in the court of aorta
And I'll watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out
Watch your car, watch your car burn
I won't forget your laugh
Go ahead and watch my heart, watch my heart burn
You know you coming back, you know you coming back
Watch your car, watch your car burn
Tryna even the score
Go ahead and watch my heart, watch my heart burn
Found guilty in the court of aorta

>>>Bad Guy Billie Eilish
<sos>
White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul? So cynical
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
I like it when you take control
Even if you know that you don't
Own me, I'll let you play the role
I'll be your animal
My mommy likes to sing along with me
But she won't sing this song
If she reads all the lyrics
She'll pity the men I know
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy
Just can't get enough guy
Chest always so puffed guy
I'm that bad type
Make your mama sad type
Make your girlfriend mad tight
Might seduce your dad type
I'm the bad guy
I'm the bad guy, duh
I'm only good at bein' bad, bad
I like when you get mad
I guess I'm pretty glad that you're alone
You said she's scared of me?
I mean, I don't see what she sees
But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne
I'm a bad guy
I'm, I'm a bad guy
Bad guy, bad guy

Mouth full of gum
My friends aren't far
In the back of my car
They'll be here pretty soon
Lookin' through my room
I'm bitin' my nails
I'm too young to go to jail
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache
The way I wear my noose
I wanna make 'em scared
Like I could be anywhere
I lost my mind
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake
My V is for Vendetta
Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache
(Bellyache, bellyache, bellyache, bellyache
Maybe it's in the gutter
Where I left my lover
What an expensive fake

Thought that I'd feel better
But now I got a bellyache

You can pretend you don't miss me 
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me 
Oh, what a shame, I'm not there
You can pretend you don't miss me 
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me 
Oh, what a shame, I'm not there
What is it you want?
You can lie, but I know that you're not fine
Every time you talk
It's all 'bout me, but you swear I'm not on your mind
You can pretend you don't miss me 
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me 
Oh, what a shame, I'm not there
You and I are suicide and stolen art 
Stitches into all your bitches' broken hearts
You can pretend you don't miss me 
You can pretend you don't care
All you wanna do is kiss me 
Oh, what a shame, I'm not there
Somebody new is gonna comfort you
Like you want me to
Somebody new is gonna comfort me
Like you never do
Every now and then, it hits me
That I'm the one that got away
But I guess being lonely fits me
And you were made for begging, "stay"
<eos>
>>>Bored Billie Eilish
<sos>
The games you played were never fun
You'd say you'd stay but then you'd run, ah
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need
I don't want any settled scores
I just want you to set me free
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need, say I need
I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need? 
When you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it
Bored, I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored
I'm home alone, you're God-knows-where
I hope you don't think that shit's fair, ah
Giving you all you want and more
Giving you every piece of me
I don't want love I can't afford
I just want you to love for free
Can't you see that I'm getting bored?
Giving you every piece of me, piece of me
I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need?
When you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it
Bored, I'm so bored, I'm so bored, so bored
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need
I don't want any settled scores
I just want you to set me free
Giving you what you're begging for
Giving you what you say I need, say I need
I'm not afraid anymore
What makes you sure you're all I need?
And when you walk out the door and leave me torn
You're teaching me to live without it

>>>Come Out and Play Billie Eilish
<sos>
Wake up and smell the coffee
Is your cup half full or empty?
When we talk, you say it softly
But I love it when you're awfully quiet
You see the piece of paper
Could be a little greater
Show me what you could make her
You'll never know until you try it
And you don't have to keep it quiet
And I know it makes you nervous
But I promise you, it's worth it
To show 'em everything you kept inside
Don't hide, don't hide
Too shy to say, but I hope you stay
Come out and play
Look up, out of your window
See snow, won't let it in though
Leave home, feel the wind blow
'Cause it's colder here inside in silence
And you don't have to keep it quiet
Yeah, I know it makes you nervous
But I promise you, it's worth it
To show 'em everything you kept inside
Don't hide, don't hide
Too shy to say but I hope you stay
Come out and play

>>>Copycat Billie Eilish
<sos>
Don't be cautious, don't be kind
You committed, I'm your crime
Push my button anytime
You got your finger on the trigger, but your trigger finger's mine
Silver dollar, golden flame
Dirty water, poison rain
Perfect murder, take your aim
I don't belong to anyone, but everybody knows my name
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine
Call me calloused, call me cold
You're italic, I'm in bold
Call me cocky, watch your tone
You better love me, 'cause you're just a clone
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine
I would hate to see you go
Hate to be the one that told you so
You just crossed the line
You've run out of time
I'm so sorry, now you know
Sorry I'm the one that told you so
Sorry, sorry, I'm sorry, sorry
By the way, you've been uninvited
'Cause all you say are all the same things I did
Copycat tryna cop my manner
Watch your back when you can't watch mine
Copycat tryna cop my glamour
Why so sad, bunny? Can't have mine

>>>Everything I Wanted Billie Eilish
<sos>
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
Not what you'd think
And if I'm bein' honest
To anyone who might care
Thought I could fly 
So I stepped off the Golden, mm
Nobody cried 
I saw them standing right there
Kinda thought they might care 
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"
I tried to scream
But my head was underwater
They called me weak
Like I'm not just somebody's daughter
Coulda been a nightmare
But it felt like they were right there
And it feels like yesterday was a year ago
But I don't wanna let anybody know
'Cause everybody wants something from me now
And I don't wanna let 'em down
I had a dream
I got everything I wanted
But when I wake up, I see
And you say, "As long as I'm here, no one can hurt you
Don't wanna lie here, but you can learn to
If I could change the way that you see yourself
You wouldn't wonder why you hear
'They don't deserve you'"
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?
If I knew it all then, would I do it again?
Would I do it again?
If they knew what they said would go straight to my head
What would they say instead?

>>>Getting Older Billie Eilish
<sos>
I'm gettin' older, I think I'm agin' well
I wish someone had told me I'd be doin' this by myself
There's reasons that I'm thankful, there's a lot I'm grateful for
But it's different when a stranger's always waitin' at your door
Which is ironic 'cause the strangers seem to want me more
Than anyone before 
Too bad they're usually deranged
Last week, I realized I crave pity
When I retell a story, I make everything sound worse
Can't shake the feeling that I'm just bad at healing
And maybe that's the reason every sentence sounds rehearsed
Which is ironic because when I wasn't honest
I was still bein' ignored 
Things I once enjoyed
Just keep me employed now
Things I'm longing for
Someday, I'll be bored of
That we care so much until we don't
I'm gettin' older, I've got more on my shoulders
But I'm gettin' better at admitting when I'm wrong
I'm happier than ever, at least, that's my endeavor
To keep myself together and prioritize my pleasure
'Cause, to be honest, I just wish that what I promise
Would depend on what I'm given, mmm 
 To be abused, mmm
Things I once enjoyed
Just keep me employed now, mmm
Things I'm longing for, mmm
Someday, I'll be bored of
That we care so much until we don't
But next week, I hope I'm somewhere laughing
For anybody asking, I promise I'll be fine
I've had some trauma, did things I didn't wanna
Was too afraid to tell ya, but now, I think it's time
<eos>
>>>Happier Than Ever Billie Eilish

When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true
Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to 
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do 
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable
So if you really wanna know
When I'm away from you 
I'm happier than ever 
Wish I could explain it better 
I wish it wasn't true, mm-mm
You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city
And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid
You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin' leave me alone, yeah

To do with your kiss on my neck
I don't know what feels true
But this feels right, so stay a sec
Yeah, you feel right, so stay a sec
And let me crawl inside your veins
I'll build a wall, give you a ball and chain
It's not like me to be so mean, you're all I wanted
Just let me hold you
Gold on your fingertips
Fingertips against my cheek
Gold leaf across your lips
Kiss me until I can't speak
Gold chain beneath your shirt
The shirt that you let me wear home
Gold's fake and real love hurts
But nothing hurts when I'm alone
When you're with me and we're alone

Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn’t mean to say "I love you"
I love you and I don't want to, ooh
Up all night on another red-eye
I wish we never learned to fly
Maybe we should just try
To tell ourselves a good lie
Didn't mean to make you cry
Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn't mean to say "I love you"

I can’t escape the way I love you
I don’t want to, but I love you, ooh

It's not like me to be so mean, you're all I wanted
Just let me hold you
Gold on your fingertips
Fingertips against my cheek
Gold leaf across your lips
Kiss me until I can't speak
Gold chain beneath your shirt
The shirt that you let me wear home
Gold's fake and real love hurts
But nothing hurts when I'm alone
When you're with me and we're alone
And let me crawl inside your veins
I'll build a wall, give you a ball and chain
It's not like me to be so mean, you're all I wanted
Just let me hold you
Tell me I’ve been lied to
Crying isn't like you, ooh
What the hell did I do?
Never been the type to
Let someone see right through, ooh
Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn’t mean to say "I love you"
I love you and I don't want to, ooh
Up all night on another red-eye
I wish we never learned to fly
Maybe we should just try
To tell ourselves a good lie
Didn't mean to make you cry
Maybe won't you take it back?
Say you were tryna make me laugh
And nothing has to change today
You didn't mean to say "I love you"
I love you and I don't want to, ooh
The smile that you gave me
Even when you felt like dying
We fall apart as it gets dark
I'm in your arms in Central Park
There's nothing you could do or say
I can’t escape the way I love you
I don’t want to, but I love you, ooh
Don't be that way
Fall apart twice a day
I just wish you could feel what you say
But I know you too well
Got a mood that you wish you could sell
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told, "A tight dress is what makes you a whore"
If "I love you" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you
Losing feeling is getting old
Was I made from a broken mold?
Hurt, I can't shake
We've made every mistake
Only you know the way that I break
If teardrops could be bottled
There'd be swimming pools filled by models
Told, "A tight dress is what makes you a whore"
If "I love you" was a promise
Would you break it, if you're honest?
Tell the mirror what you know she's heard before
I don't wanna be you
>>>Ilomilo Billie Eilish

When I'm away from you
I'm happier than ever
Wish I could explain it better
I wish it wasn't true
Give me a day or two to think of something clever
To write myself a letter
To tell me what to do, mm-mm
Do you read my interviews?
Or do you skip my avenue?
When you said you were passin' through
Was I even on your way?
I knew when I asked you to 
Be cool about what I was tellin' you
You'd do the opposite of what you said you'd do 
And I'd end up more afraid
Don't say it isn't fair
You clearly werеn't aware that you made me misеrable
So if you really wanna know
When I'm away from you 
I'm happier than ever 
Wish I could explain it better 
I wish it wasn't true, mm-mm
You call me again, drunk in your Benz
Drivin' home under the influence
You scared me to death, but I'm wastin' my breath
'Cause you only listen to your fuckin' friends
I don't relate to you
I don't relate to you, no
'Cause I'd never treat me this shitty
You made me hate this city
And I don't talk shit about you on the internet
Never told anyone anything bad
'Cause that shit's embarrassing, you were my everything
And all that you did was make me fuckin' sad
So don't waste the time I don't have
And don't try to make me feel bad
I could talk about every time that you showed up on time
But I'd have an empty line 'cause you never did
Never paid any mind to my mother or friends, so I
Shut 'em all out for you 'cause I was a kid
You ruined everything good
Always said you were misunderstood
Made all my moments your own
Just fuckin' leave me alone, yeah 
I wanna be alone
Alone with you, does that make sense?
I wanna steal your soul
And hide you in my treasure chest
I don't know what to do
To do with your kiss on my neck
I don't know what feels true
But this feels right, so stay a sec
Yeah, you feel right, so stay a sec
And let me crawl inside your veins
I'll build a wall, give you a ball and chain
It's not like me to be so mean, you're all I wanted
Just let me hold you
Gold on your fingertips
Fingertips against my cheek
Gold leaf across your lips
Kiss me until I can't speak
Gold chain beneath your shirt
The shirt that you let me wear home
Gold's fake and real love hurts
But nothing hurts when I'm alone
When you're with me and we're alone

Told you not to worry
But maybe that's a lie
Honey, what's your hurry?
Won't you stay inside?
Remember not to get too close to stars
They're never gonna give you love like ours
Where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
So show me the way home
I can't lose another life
The world's a little blurry
Or maybe it's my eyes
The friends I've had to bury
They keep me up at night
Said I couldn't love someone
'Cause I might break
If you're gonna die, not by mistake
So, where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
So tell me you'll come home
Even if it's just a lie
I tried not to upset you
Let you rescue me the day I met you
I just wanted to protect you
But now I'll never get to
Where did you go?
I should know, but it's cold
And I don't wanna be lonely
Was hoping you'd come home
I don't care if it's a lie

El amor no puede medirse en paso' firme'
Un día soy un Dio' y al otro puedo partirme
I needed to go 'cause I needed to know you don't need me
You reap what you sow, but it seems like you don't even see me
El amor no puede medirse en paso' firme'
Un día soy un Dio' y al otro puedo partirme
You say it to me like it's something I have any choice in
If I wasn't important, then why would you waste all your poison?

>>>Lost Cause Billie Eilish

Something's in the air right now
Like I'm losin' track of time 
Like I don't really care right now
But maybe that's fine
You weren't even there that day
I was waitin' on you 
I wonder if you were aware that day
Was the last straw for me and I knew
I sent you flowers
Did you even care?
You ran the shower
And left them by the stairs
Thought you had your shit together, but damn, I was wrong 
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause 
And this ain't nothin' like it oncе was 
I know you think you're such an outlaw
But you got no job 
You ain't nothin' but a lost cause 
And this ain't nothin' likе it once was 
I know you think you're such an outlaw
But you got no job
I used to think you were shy 
But maybe you just had nothing on your mind
Maybe you were thinkin' 'bout yourself all the time
I used to wish you were mine 
But that was way before I realized
Someone like you would always be so easy to find
Gave me no flowers
Wish I didn't care
You'd be gone for hours
Thought you would've grown eventually, but you proved me wrong 
You ain't nothing but a lost cause 
And this ain't nothing like it once was 
I know you think you're such an outlaw 
But you got no job 
You ain't nothing but a lost cause 
And this ain't nothing like it once was 
I know you think you're such an outlaw 
But you got no job

>>>Lovely Billie Eilish

Thought I found a way
Thought I found a way out 
But you never go away 
So I guess I gotta stay now
Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear
Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Walking out of time
Looking for a better place 
Something's on my mind
Always in my head space
But I know someday I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear
Isn't it lovely, all alone?
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone

Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Home alone, tryin' not to eat
Distract myself with pornography
I hate the way she looks at me
I can't stand the dialogue, she would never be
That satisfied, it's a male fantasy
I'm goin' back to therapy
'Cause I loved you then and I love you now
And I don't know how
Guess it's hard to know when nobody else comes around
If I'm getting over you
Or just pretending to
Be alright, convince myself I hate you
I got a call from a girl I used to know
We were inseparablе years ago
Thought we'd get along, but it wasn't so
And it's all I think about whеn I'm behind the wheel
I worry this is how I'm always gonna feel
But nothing lasts, I know the deal
But I loved you then and I love you now
And I don't know how
Guess it's hard to know when nobody else comes around
If I'm getting over you
Or just pretending to
Be alright, convince myself I hate you
Can't get over you
No matter what I do
I know I should, but I could never hate you

Don't love me like he promised
My boy, my boy, my boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest
My boy's bein' sus and he don't know how to cuss
He just sounds like he's tryna be his father 
My boy's an ugly crier but he's such a pretty liar
And by that, I mean he said he'd change
My boy, my boy, my boy
Don't love me like he promised
My boy, my boy, my boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest
My boy, my-my boy, my friends
I love-love, I-I love-love my split ends
My boy 
My-my boy 
My boy, my 
My boy, my boy, my boy
Don't love me like he promised
My boy, my boy, my boy
He ain't a man and sure as hell ain't honest

And if you want a good girl, then goodbye

I can't seem to focus
And you don't seem to notice I'm not here
To find your reflection's all alone
Can't you hear me?
I'm not comin' home
'Cause I, I'm in love
Can't wait to meet her
And I , I'm in love
But not with anybody else
Just wanna get to know myself
I know supposedly I'm lonely now 
Know I'm supposed to be unhappy
But aren't I someone? 
I'd  like to be your answer 
'Cause you're so handsome 
But I know better
Than to drive you home
'Cause you'd invite me in
And I'd be yours again
But I , I'm in love 
And you don't know her 
And I, I'm in love 
But not with anybody here
I'll see you in a couple years

>>>My Strange Addiction Billie Eilish

No, Billy, I haven't done that dance since my wife died
There’s a whole crowd of people out there who need to learn how to do The Scarn
Don't ask questions you don't wanna know
Learned my lesson way too long ago
To be talkin’ to you, belladonna
Shoulda taken a break, not an Oxford comma
Take what I want when I wanna
And I want ya
One of us is gonna lose
I'm the powder, you're the fuse
Just add some friction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction
I'm really, really sorry, I think I was just relieved
To see that Michael Scarn got his confidence back
Yeah, Michael, the movie is amazing
It's like, one of the best movies I've ever seen in my life
Deadly fever, please don't ever break
Be my reliever ’cause I don’t self medicate
And it burns like a gin and I like it
Put your lips on my skin and you might ignite it
Hurts, but I know how to hide it, kinda like it 
One of us is gonna lose
I'm the powder, you’re the fuse
Just add some friction
You are my strange addiction
My doctors can't explain
My symptoms or my pain
But you are my strange addiction
Bite my glass, set myself on fire
Can't you tell I'm crass? Can’t you tell I'm wired?
Tell me nothing lasts, like I don't know
You could kiss my— asking about my motto
You should enter it in festivals or carnivals
Thoughts? Pretty good reaction
You are my strange addiction

Says he's Satan and he'd like to meet
I bought a secret house when I was seventeen 
Haven't had a party since I got the keys
Had a pretty boy over, but he couldn't stay
On his way out, made him sign an NDA, mm
Yeah, I made him sign an NDA
Once was good enough
'Cause I don't want him havin' shit to say, oh-oh-oh
You couldn't save me, but you can't let me go, oh, no
I can crave you, but you don't need to know, oh-oh
30 Under 30 for another year 
I can barely go outside, I think I hate it herе 
Maybе I should think about a new career 
Somewhere in Kauai where I can disappear
I've been havin' fun gettin' older now
Didn't change my number, made him shut his mouth 
At least I gave him somethin' he can cry about
I thought about my future, but I want it now, oh-oh-oh
Want it now, mm-mm-mm
You can't give me up
You couldn't save me, but you can't let me go, oh, no
I can crave you, but you don't need to know, oh-oh

That the blood you bleed is just the blood you owe
But I saw you there
Too much to bear
You were my life, but life is far away from fair
Was I stupid to love you?
Was I reckless to help?
Was it obvious to everybody else?
That I'd fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry
There's just no time to die
I let it burn
You're no longer my concern, mmm
Faces from my past return
Another lesson yet to learn
That I'd fallen for a lie
You were never on my side
Fool me once, fool me twice
Are you death or paradise?
Now you'll never see me cry

No time to die, mmm

>>>Not My Responsibility Billie Eilish
<sos>
Do you know me?
You have opinions about my opinions
Some people hate what I wear
Some people praise it
Some people use it to shame others
Some people use it to shame me
And nothing I do goes unseen
So while I feel your stares, your disapproval or your sigh of relief
If I lived by them, I'd never be able to move
Would you like me to be smaller, weaker, softer, taller?
Would you like me to be quiet?
Do my shoulders provoke you? Does my chest?
Am I my stomach? My hips?
The body I was born with
Is it not what you wanted?
If I wear what is comfortable, I am not a woman
If I shed the layers, I'm a slut
Though you've never seen my body, you still judge it
And judge me for it
We make assumptions about people based on their size
We decide who they are
We decide what they're worth
If I wear more, if I wear less
Who decides what that makes me? What that means?
Is my value based only on your perception?
Or is your opinion of me not my responsibility?You might also like

Fallin' into your ocean eyes
I've been walkin' through a world gone blind

Careful creature made friends with time
He left her lonely with a diamond mind

Don't wanna treat you well 
Can't take it back once it's been set in motion

If you find it hard to swallow, I can loosen up your collar
'Cause as long as you're still breathing
Don't you even think of leaving
Not gonna wanna look away, look away, look away
You're gonna wanna get involved, involved, involved
And what would people say, people say, people say
If they listen through the wall, the wall, the wall?
I can see it clear as day
You don't really need a break
Wanna see what you can take
You should really run away
Other people wouldn't stay
Other people don't obey
You and me are both the same
You should really run away
I wanna do bad things to you
I wanna make you yell
I wanna do bad things to you
Don't wanna treat you well

>>>Party Favor Billie Eilish
<sos>
Hey, leave a message
Hey, call me back when ya get this
Or when you've got a minute
We really need to talk
Wait, you know what?
Maybe just forget it
'Cause by the time you get this
Your number might be blocked
"Stay" and "blah blah blah"
You just want what you can't have
I'll call the cops
If you don't stop, I'll call your dad
And I hate to do this to you on your birthday
Happy birthday, by the way
"It's not you, it's me" and all that other bullshit
You know that's bullshit
I'm not your party favor
Look, now I know we coulda done it better
But we can't change the weather
When the weather's come and gone
Books don't make sense if you read 'em backwards
You'll single out the wrong words
Like you mishear all my songs
You'll hear "stay" and "blah blah blah"
You just want what you can't have
I'll call the cops
If you don't stop, I'll call your dad
And I hate to do this to you on your birthday
Happy birthday by the way
"It's not you, it's me" and all that other bullshit
You know that's bullshit
I'm not your party favor

>>>Six Feet Under Billie Eilish
<sos>
Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
It won't end well
But I wish you'd tell me to
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
It's all too much for me
Like smoke in air
How can you die carelessly?
Our love is six feet under
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
They're playin' our sound
Layin' us down tonight
And all of these clouds
Crying us back to life
But you're cold as a knife
I can't help but wonder
If our grave was watered by the rain
Help, I lost myself again
But I remember you
<eos>
>>>Therefore I Am Billie Eilish
<sos>
I'm not your friend
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
Stop, what the hell are you talking about? Ha
Get my pretty name out of your mouth
We are not the same with or without
Don't talk 'bout me like how you might know how I feel
Top of the world, but your world isn't real
Your world's an ideal
So go have fun
I really couldn't care less
And you can give 'em my best, but just know
I'm not your friend
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I don't want press to put your name next to mine
We're on different lines, so I
Wanna be nice enough, they don't call my bluff
'Cause I hate to find
Rather you remain unremarkable 
When they say your name, I just act confused
Did you have fun?
I really couldn't care less
And you can give 'em my best, but just know
I'm not your friend
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am
I don't think I caught your name
I'm not your friend 
You think that you're the man 
I think, therefore, I am
I'm not your friend 
Or anything, damn 
You think that you're the man
I think, therefore, I am

>>>Watch Billie Eilish
<sos>
Lips meet teeth and tongue
My heart skips eight beats at once
If we were meant to be, we would have been by now
See what you wanna see, but all I see is him right now
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out
Your love feels so fake
And my demands aren't high to make
If I could get to sleep, I would have slept by now
Your lies will never keep, I think you need to blow 'em out
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Go ahead and watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out
When you call my name
Do you think I'll come runnin'?
You never did the same
So good at givin' me nothin'
When you close your eyes, do you picture me?
When you fantasize, am I your fantasy?
I'll sit and watch your car burn
With the fire that you started in me
But you never came back to ask it out
Watch my heart burn
With the fire that you started in me
But I'll never let you back to put it out
Ooh, never let you back
Let you back, let you back
Never gonna let you back

I used to float, now I just fall down
I used to know, but I'm not sure now
What I was made for
What was I made for?
Takin' a drive, I was an ideal
Looked so alive, turns out I'm not real
Just somethin' you paid for
What was I made for?
I don't know how to feel
But I wanna try
I don't know how to feel
But someday, I might
When did it end? All the enjoyment
I'm sad again, don't tell my boyfriend
It's not what he's made for
What was I made for?
'Cause I, 'cause I
I don't know how to feel
But I wanna try
I don't know how to feel
But someday, I might
Think I forgot how to be happy
Somethin' I'm not, but somethin' I can be
Somethin' I wait for
Somethin' I'm made for
Somethin' I'm made for

>>>When I Was Older Billie Eilish
<sos>
When I was older
I was a sailor on an open sea
But now I'm underwater
And my skin is paler than it should ever be
I'm on my back again
Dreaming of a time and place
Where you and I remain the best of friends
Even after all this ends
I'm on my, I'm on my back again
It's seeming more and more
Like all we ever do is see how far it bends
Before it breaks in half and then
We bend it back again
Guess I got caught in the middle of it
Yes I've been taught, got a little of it
In my blood, in my blood
Memories burn like a forest fire
Heavy rain turns any funeral pyre to mud
When I was older
I was a sailor on an open sea
But now I'm underwater
And my skin is paler than it should ever be
I'm watching movies back to back in black and white, I never
Seen anybody do it like I do it any better
Been goin' over you, I'm overdue for new endeavors
Nobody lonely like I'm lonely and I don't know whether
You'd really like it in the limelight
You'd sympathize with all the bad guys
I'm still a victim in my own right
But I'm the villain in my own eyes, yeah
When I was older
I was a sailor on an open sea

>>>When the Party's Over Billie Eilish
<sos>
Don't you know I'm no good for you?
I've learned to lose you, can't afford to
Tore my shirt to stop you bleedin'
But nothin' ever stops you leavin'
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Don't you know too much already?
I'll only hurt you if you let me
Call me friend, but keep me closer 
And I'll call you when the party's over
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
And I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
Yeah, I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
But nothin' is better sometimes
Once we've both said our goodbyes
Let's just let it go
Let me let you go
Quiet when I'm coming home and I'm on my own
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that
I could lie, say I like it like that, like it like that

>>>Wish You Were Gay Billie Eilish

"Baby, I don't feel so good," six words you never understood
"I'll never let you go," five words you'll never say 
I laugh along like nothing's wrong, four days has never felt so long
If three's a crowd and two was us, one slipped away 
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
Is there a reason we're not through?
Is there a 12 step just for you?
Our conversation's all in blue
11 "heys" 
Ten fingers tearin' out my hair
Nine times you never made it there
I ate alone at 7, you were six minutes away
How am I supposed to make you feel okay
When all you do is walk the other way?
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
To spare my pride
To give your lack of interest an explanation
Don't say I'm not your type
Just say that I'm not your preferred sexual orientation
But you make me feel helpless, yeah
And I can't stand another day
I just wanna make you feel okay
But all you do is look the other way, hmm
I can't tell you how much I wish I didn't wanna stay
I just kinda wish you were gay
I just kinda wish you were gay

>>>Xanny Billie Eilish
<sos>
What is it about them?
I must be missing something
They just keep doing nothing
Too intoxicated to be scared
Better off without them
They're nothing but unstable
Bring ashtrays to the table
And that's about the only thing they share
I'm in their secondhand smoke
Still just drinking canned Coke
I don't need a Xanny to feel better
On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me a Xanny, now or ever
Can you check your Uber rating? Oh my god
Wakin' up at sundown 
They're late to every party 
Nobody's ever sorry 
Too inebriated now to dance
Morning as they come down 
Their pretty heads are hurting 
They're awfully bad at learning 
Make the same mistakes, blame circumstance
I'm in their secondhand smoke
Still just drinking canned Coke
I don't need a Xanny to feel better
On designated drives home
Only one who's not stoned
Don't give me a Xanny, now or ever
Please don't try to kiss me on the sidewalk
On your cigarette break
I can't afford to love someone
Who isn't dying by mistake in Silver Lake
What is it about them?
I must be missing something
They just keep doin' nothing
Too intoxicated to be scared
Hmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

Bite my tongue, bide my time
Wearing a warning sign
Wait 'til the world is mine
Cold in my kingdom size
Fell for these ocean eyes
You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
One by one by
You should see me in a crown
Your silence is my favorite sound
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one
Count my cards, watch them fall
Blood on a marble wall
I like the way they all scream
Tell me which one is worse
Living or dying first
Sleeping inside a hearse 
You say, "Come over, baby
I think you're pretty"
I'm okay, I'm not your baby
If you think I'm pretty
You should see me in a crown
I'm gonna run this nothing town
Watch me make 'em bow
One by one by one

Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But havin' it's so strange
She said you were a hero
You played the part
But you ruined her in a year
Don't act like it was hard
And you swear you didn't know 
No wonder why you didn't ask
She was sleepin' in your clothes 
But now she's got to get to class
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad when they find out?
If you could take it all back
Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But havin' it's so strange
I thought that I was special
You made me feel
Like it was my fault, you were the devil
Does it keep you in control? 
For you to keep her in a cage?
And you swear you didn't know 
You said you thought she was your age
And how could you?
Will you only feel bad if it turns out
That they kill your contract?
Try not to abuse your power
I know we didn't choose to change
You might not wanna lose your power
But power isn't pain

Now let's get outta this town, outta this club

How 'bout a night to remember and a fifth of Goose?
'Bout to bust out my honky tonk attitude
A little feel good you ain't never felt before
I'm talkin' 1994, hey
Joe, Joe, Joe Diffie
Girl, don't you worry, now your ship just came in
So go on and tell your mama, tell all your friends

>>>Amarillo Sky Jason Aldean

He gets up before the dawn
Packs a lunch and a thermos full of coffee
It's another day in the dusty haze
Those burnin' rays are wearin' down his body
The diesel's worth the price of gold
It's the cheapest grain he's ever sold
But he's still holdin' on
He just takes the tractor another round
And pulls the plow across the ground
And sends up another prayer
He says, "Lord, I never complain, I never ask 'Why?'
Please don't let my dreams run dry
Underneath, underneath this Amarillo Sky"
That hail storm back in '83
Sure did take a toll on his family
But he stayed strong and carried on
Just like his Dad and Granddad did before him
On his knees every night
He prays, "Please let my crops and children grow"
'Cause that's all he's ever known
He just takes the tractor another round
And pulls the plow across the ground
And sends up another prayer
He says, "Lord, I never complain, I never ask 'Why?'
Please don't let my dreams run dry
Underneath, underneath this Amarillo Sky"
And he takes the tractor another round. 
Another round , another round
And he takes the tractor another round, another round
He says, "I never complain, I never ask 'Why?'
Please don't let my dreams run dry
Underneath, underneath this Amarillo Sky"
"Underneath this Amarillo Sky"

Girl, you know those rumors get to flyin' in a town this size
No, I didn't feel a thing when you threw that ring and slammed the door
If you wanna know the truth you gotta go straight to the source
Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my Coke now
A little more high in my smoke now
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I ain't sittin' 'round
The thought of you
Ask any ol' barstool
I can finally stretch out in our king size bed if I make it that far
But fillin' in all these blanks you left isn't all that hard
No, I ain't wonderin' where you been or who you been with
I guess you didn't hurt me half as bad as you think you did
Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my Coke now
A little more high in my smoke now
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I ain't sittin' 'round
The thought of you
Ask any ol' barstool
Yeah, you think I'm down and out, hidin' out, hell-bent crazy
But that ain't me, baby
Ask any ol' barstool in this town
Ask my new found party crowd
Sure I take more Jack in my Coke now
But I'm a long way from broke down
Sure I stay 'til they're all long gone
And I take the long way home
But I ain't sittin' 'round

Sittin' in the drive but she wouldn't get out

And I just laughed and said "Y'all get in"
She had on a new dress and she'd curled her hair
She was lookin' too good not to go somewhere
Said what you want to do, baby, I don't care
We can go to the show, or we can stay right here
And I can take you for a ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster
Down through the woods and out to the pasture
Long as I'm with you it really don't matter
Climb up in my lap and drive if you want to
Girl, you know you got me to hold on to
We can go to town but baby, if you'd rather
I'll take you for a ride on my big green tractor
Said we can fire it up and I can show you around
Sit up on the hill and watch the sun go down
When the fireflies are dancin' and the moon comes out
We can turn on the lights and head back to the house
Or we can take another ride on my big green tractor
We can go slow or make it go faster

I wouldn't blame you if you didn't even miss me
Gave you a million reasons, girl, not to be with me

Let it take the blame for why you told me goodbye
Instead of missin' you and missin' all those good times
Should've never let you go
Should've never watched you go

I could drink around the truth
But I can't blame it on you

Shake off the where you came from dust
Grab your guitar, walk down the street
Sign says "Nashville, Tennessee"
But I have found
It's a crazy town full of neon dreams
Everybody plays, everybody sings
Hollywood with a touch of twang
To be a star you got to bang-bang-bang
Bend those strings 'til the Hank comes out
Make all the drunk girls scream and shout
We love it, we hate it, we're all just tryin' to make it
In this crazy town
You pay your dues and you play for free
And you pray for a honky tonk destiny
You cut your teeth in the smokey bars
And live off the tips from a pickle jar
'Til you find a cool new sound
And you smile when the record man shoots you down
It's a crazy town full of neon dreams
Everybody plays, everybody sings
Hollywood with a touch of twang
To be a star you got to bang-bang-bang
Bend those strings 'til the Hank comes out
Make all the drunk girls scream and shout
We love it, we hate it, we're all just tryin' to make it
In this crazy town
One year they repossess your truck
And the next you make a couple million bucks
It's a crazy town full of neon dreams
Everybody plays, everybody sings
Hollywood with a touch of twang
To be a star you got to bang-bang-bang
Bend those strings 'til the Hank comes out
Make all the drunk girls scream and shout
We love it, we hate it, we're all just tryin' to make it
We love it, we hate it, we all came here to make it
In this crazy town
It's a crazy town

>>>Dirt Road Anthem Jason Aldean
<sos>
Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires
Back in the day Pott's farm was the place to go
Load the truck up, hit the dirt road
Jump the barbwire, spread the word
Light the bonfire, then call the girls
The king in the can and the Marlboro man
Jack 'n' Jim were a few good men
Where ya learned how to kiss and cuss and fight too
Better watch out for the boys in blue
And all this small town he said, she said
Ain't it funny how rumors spread
Like I know something y'all don't know
Man that talk is getting old
Ya better mind your business, man, watch your mouth
Before I have to knock that loud mouth out
I'm tired of talkin', man, y'all ain't listening
Them old dirt roads is what y'all missing
Yeah I'm chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones

Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times
I'm turning off of real life drivin', that's right
I'm hittin' easy street on mud tires
I sit back and think about them good ol' days
The way we were raised and our southern ways
And we like cornbread and biscuits
And if it's broke round here we fix it
I can take y'all where you need to go
Down to my hood, back in them woods
We do it different 'round here, that's right
But we sure do it good and we do it all night
See, if you really wanna know how it feels
To get off the road with trucks and four wheels
Jump on in, and man, tell your friends
We'll raise some hell where the blacktop ends
Chillin' on a dirt road
Laid back swervin' like I'm George Jones
Smoke rollin' out the window
An ice cold beer sittin' in the console
Memory lane up in the headlights
It's got me reminiscin' on them good times

Touchin' your skin, and your hair fallin' slow
But when a goodbye kiss, feels like this
Don't you wanna stay here a little while?
Don't you wanna hold each other tight?
Don't you wanna fall asleep with me tonight?
Don't you wanna stay here a little while?
We can make forever feel this way
Don't you wanna stay?
Let's take it slow, I don't wanna move too fast
I don't wanna just make love, I wanna make love last
When you're up this high, it's a sad goodbye
Don't you wanna stay here a little while?
Don't you wanna hold each other tight?
Don't you wanna fall asleep with me tonight?
Don't you wanna stay here a little while?
We can make forever feel this way
Don't you wanna stay?
Oh, you feel so perfect, baby
Yeah, you feel so perfect, baby
Don't you wanna stay here a little while?
Don't you wanna hold each other tight?
Don't you wanna fall asleep with me tonight?

Man you ever just wanna, go ridin' around
No worries, well that's this kind of song
This is for everybody out there, circlin' the town square
Proud to be stuck out in the middle of nowhere
USA, Chevrolet, Dodge and Ford
Raisin' a little hell and praising the Lord 
Just simple truth speakin', workin' for the weekend
Every time it hits the fan you just keep on keepin'
You tried and true, red white and blue
Turn it up, turn it up, man, this one’s for you, woo
Hey, this is for the drivin' around
Jack and Diane town, anywhere Saturday night
Yeah, yeah, this is for the back road
Turning up the radio, heading right
Where the two lane turns into Main Street
Cruisin' the same streets
Over in the passenger seat
Baby ain't never looked better just singin' along
To this drivin' around song
Yeah, I know what I’m talkin' about
I grew up in them rural routes
Counting down them days 'til I got brave enough to bust out
City lights in my sights, I’m gonna do it up right
I’m sittin' here with this guitar tonight, alright
Kickin' it in the big town, wishin' I'd a slowed it down
And I give anything if I was drivin' around
With the big dreams in my pocket
Yeah, this is for the ones who don’t know how good they got it
Hey, this is for the drivin' around
Jack and Diane town, anywhere Saturday night
Yeah, yeah, this is for the back road
Turning up the radio, heading right
Where the two lane turns into Main Street
Cruisin' the same streets
Over in the passenger seat
Baby ain't never looked better just singin' along
To this drivin' around song
Get in your truck, get in your car, whatever it is, 
Small town America, baby
We’re goin' drive it around
Hey, this is for the drivin' around
Jack and Diane town, anywhere Saturday night
Yeah, yeah, this is for the back road
Turnin' up the radio, heading right
Where the two lane turns into Main Street, that's right
Cruisin' the same streets
Over in the passenger seat
Baby ain't never looked better just singin' along, just singin' along

Hey, hey this is for the drivin' around, Jack and Diane town

>>>Drowns the Whiskey Jason Aldean
<sos>
All the folks down in Lynchburg, Tennessee
Been working hard for good ol' boys like me
I don't wanna be the one to tell 'em
That stuff that they've been selling
Ain't working like it should
But I damn sure wish it would
Whiskey's supposed to drown the memory
I've gone from one to one too many
And the thing that really gets me
Is how your memory drowns the whiskey
Maybe it's the bar or the stool I'm on
Maybe it's the band and the sad old song
That keeps me buying rounds
That keeps me turning down
Any girl that wants to dance
And you ain't giving them a chance
Whiskey's supposed to drown the memory
I've gone from one to one too many
And the thing that really gets me
Is how your memory drowns the whiskey
Girl, I'm living proof that 80 proof
Ain't got a shot at touching you
But whiskey's supposed to drown the memory
I've gone from one to one too many
And the thing that really gets me
Is whiskey's supposed to drown the memory
I've gone from one to one too many
And the thing that really gets me
Is how your memory drowns the whiskey
Yeah the thing that really gets me
Is how your memory drowns the whiskey
All the folks down in Lynchburg, Tennessee
Been working hard for good old boys like me

>>>Fly Over States Jason Aldean
<sos>
A couple of guys in first class on a flight
From New York to Los Angeles
Kinda making small talk killing time
Flirting with the flight attendants
Thirty-thousand feet above, could be Oklahoma
Just a bunch of square cornfields and wheat farms
Man, it all looks the same
Miles and miles of back roads and highways
Connecting little towns with funny names
Who'd want to live down there in the middle of nowhere?
They've never drove through Indiana
Met the men who plowed that earth
Planted that seed, busted his ass for you and me
Or caught a harvest moon in Kansas
They'd understand why God made
I bet that mile long Santa Fe freight train engineer's seen it all
Just like that flatbed cowboy stacking US steel on a 3-day haul
Roads and rails under their feet
Yeah that sounds like a first class seat
On the plains of Oklahoma
With a windshield sunset in your eyes
Like a water-colored painted sky
You'll think heaven's doors have opened
You'll understand why God made
Take a ride across the badlands
Feel that freedom on your face
Breathe in all that open space
And meet a girl from Amarillo
You'll understand why God made
You might even wanna plant your stakes
In those flyover states
Have you ever been through Indiana?
On the plains of Oklahoma?
>>>Girl Like You Jason Aldean
<sos>
Love how you close your eyes when I pull you in closer
Tonight's movin' fast but we ain't takin' it slower
You hit me harder than a drink does
You're gonna take me all the way up
Something about you baby, got me goin' crazy
I don't know what to do
I've never met a girl like you
That's ever done it quite like you do
Your kiss is double-barrel bourbon on rocks
Your lips are just the cherry on top
I've never been high like this
Turn out the lights and let me breathe you in
Your eyes are so diamond, body so gold
An' I don't want to let you go
I've never met a girl like you
Love how you say my name and make it sound so sexy
Love how you do that thing, yeah you know what gets me
I'm talkin' slow motion all night long
Baby, love you with the lights on
I've never met a girl like you
That's ever done it quite like you do
Your kiss is double-barrel bourbon on rocks
Your lips are just the cherry on top
I've never been high like this
Turn out the lights and let me breathe you in
Your eyes are so diamond, body so gold
An' I don't want to let you go
I've never met a girl like you
That's ever done it quite like you do
Your kiss is double-barrel bourbon on rocks
Your lips are just the cherry on top

>>>Gonna Know We Were Here Jason Aldean

You got the gas
I got the matches
We gonna turn this town to ashes
Cause they ain't never seen nothing like us
Ain't heard loud till we turn it up
I got the wild
You got the crazy
You know that's why I love you baby
Cause your motor runs just as fast as mine
Pedal to the metal, keep your throttle down all night
And we only get one life
Ain't scared to ride this train
Make a few marks, leave a few stains
Might slam just a little too hard
Might take it just a little too far
Might burn out like a firework
Like a shooting star across the sky
And we may not be around in 20 years
But they're sure gonna know we were here
Yeah, they're sure gonna know we were here
You know damn well
When they got a good tale to tell
Let's give them something they ain't never seen
A little Rated R redneck dream
Let's blaze a trail through the dirty south
Or give them something they can talk about
A little story that they won't forget
Long after we ride off into the sunset
Baby, cause we ain't dead yet, baby
Ain't scared to ride this train
Make a few marks, leave a few stains
Might slam just a little too hard
Might take it just a little too far
Might burn out like a firework
Like a shooting star across the sky
And we may not be around in 20 years
But they're sure gonna know we were here
We only get one chance around
This runaway roller coaster train
And it ain't slowing down
So baby they're gonna remember our name
Ain't scared to ride this train
Make a few marks, leave a few stains
Might slam just a little too hard
Might take it just a little too far
Might burn out like a firework
Like a shooting star across the sky
And we may not be around in 20 years
No, we may not be around in 20 years
But they're sure gonna know we were here

You're perfect for me
Everything I'll ever need

The old me before you belongs to the past
In the back of your mind, you might think there's somethin' more I want
But when I got what I got, girl, I don't
I said, "Baby, do you know you sound a little crazy
When you're talkin' like that, girl?"
Ain't no second thoughts, no regrets, no kinda maybe
No wishin' I turned back
Before you came along
I could go all alone
Girl, just kiss me
You're all that I want
When I got what I got, I don't miss what I had
The old me before you belongs to the past
In the back of your mind, you might think there's somethin' more I want

He's gonna lay a little rubber later on at the truck pull
And all the girls are gettin' pretty, they're sprayin' on the White Rain
Yeah, they're gonna get a rowdy tonight down at the football game
Yeah, we let it rip
When we got the money, let it roll
If we got the gas it gets wild
Yeah, but that's the way we get down
Well, you can see the neighbors butt crack nailin' on his shingles
And his woman smokin' Pall Malls watchin' Laura Ingalls
And Granny's gettin' lit, she's headin' out to bingo
Yeah, my buddies and me are goin' muddin' down on Blue Hole Road
You know, you know
Yeah, we let it rip
When we got the money, let it roll
If we got the gas it gets wild
Yeah, but that's the way we get down
Oh, stand on it

And they like to show off in their fancy foreign cars
Out here in the boondocks we buy beer at Amoco
And crank our Kraco speakers with that country radio

>>>If I Didn't Love You Jason Aldean
<sos>
I wouldn't mind bein' alone
I wouldn't keep checkin' my phone
Wouldn't take the long way home
Just to drive myself crazy
I wouldn't be losin' sleep
Everything you said to me
Like I'm doin' lately
You, you wouldn't be all
All that I want
Baby, I could let go
If I didn't love you I'd be good by now
I'd be better than barely gettin' by somehow
Yeah, it would be easy not to miss you
Wonder about who's with you
Turn the want you off whenever I want to
If I didn't love you
I wouldn't still cry sometimes
Wouldn't have to fake a smile
Play it off and tell a lie
When somebody asked how I've been
I'd try to find someone new 
It should be somethin' I can do 
Baby, if it weren't for you
I wouldn't be in the state that I'm in
You wouldn't be all
All that I want
Baby, I could let go
If I didn't love you I'd be good by now

I knew the minute that I picked you up
It was gonna be a wild ride
You kissed me like you couldn't get enough
Barely made it out of your drive
Burn a little rubber at the red light
Got a little warning from the blue lights
It's only going nine o'clock but feels more like midnight
We ain't even turned up the radio
Ain't been two miles down the road
The way you look at me baby I don't know
If we even gonna make it to the party
Yeah we gotta whole lot of moonlight left
Already having the time of my lives
And we're just getting started tonight
Girl you already got the window down
And you got your seat laid back
I ain't even made it halfway to town
And you're already talking about a six pack
Already got your shoes off
And you talking about slipping off
No we ain't even found your friends saying
You already wanna get lost
We ain't even turned up the radio
Ain't been two miles down the road
The way you look at me baby I don't know
If we even gonna make it to the party
Yeah we gotta whole lot of moonlight left
Already having the time of my lives

Ain't had a drink and I'm tore up
Ain't even had a taste of your love
But girl the crazy thing is
We're just getting warmed up

>>>Laughed Until We Cried Jason Aldean
<sos>
Goin' through my closet the other day
I found an old yearbook, flipped right to the page
Of that senior trip
Down there on that Panama strip
We all started yellin' when we smelled the beach
Couldn't wait to try our fake I.D.'s
We only had a few days
And a whole lot of memories to make
Oh, man, we were livin'
Didn't waste one minute
We talked and drank and danced and said goodbye
We laughed until we cried
This past year my family
Was sittin' cross-legged 'round the Christmas tree
We all knew it'd probably be his last
He was crackin' jokes and we were takin' turns
Tellin' stories 'bout fishin' or lessons learned
Out on the porch with him
We all felt like kids again
Oh, man, we were livin'
We sang and talked and traveled back in time
We laughed until we cried
It's like the best days under the sun
Every emotion rolled into one
A little of this, a little of that
Kinda happy, kinda sad
Just the other night the baby was cryin'
So, I got out of bed rocked her awhile
And I held her tight
And I told her it would be alright
And my mind went back to a few years ago
When we tried so long, we almost gave up hope
And I remember you
Comin' in and tellin' me the news
Oh, man, we were livin'
Goin' crazy in the kitchen
We danced and screamed and held each other tight
We laughed until we cried
<eos>
>>>Lights Come On Jason Aldean
<sos>
You're a crack of dawn, Monday morning, coffee strong
Poured everything you got into a paycheck Friday night
You're a Powerstroke diesel, backhoe riding king of beers, 18-wheeler driving, living life in between the lines
Of clocking in and quitting time
But then the six string circus comes to town
We hang them speakers over the crowd
When the lights come on, everybody's screaming
Lighters in the sky, yeah, everybody's singing
Every word to every song to the girl they're taking home tonight
When the lights come on, everybody's feeling
A hallelujah high from the floor to the ceiling
Yeah, the drink that we're drinking, the smoke that we're smoking
The party we throw, it's going all night long
When the lights come on
You're a little shy thing with a wild side
On a night like this, you just can't hide

>>>A Little More Summertime Jason Aldean
<sos>
They boarding up this water town
Ain't nobody hanging around
Another grey September day
Was I crazy to think she'd stay
If that sun would have just hung up in that sky
Just a little bit, yeah, just a little bit longer
If those blue water waves
Could've stayed at our feet on the beach
Instead of going out with the tide
If that wind was a friend
It'd still be blowing in, like a warm southern whisper on her 
She might have stayed forever and never ever left these arms
If only I, had a little more summertime
I brace myself against the cold
And let her memory take hold
Stirring that old fire up
As if I don't miss her enough
If that sun would have just hung up in that sky
Just a little bit, yeah, just a little bit longer 
If those blue water waves
Could've stayed at our feet on the beach
Instead of going out with the tide
If that wind was a friend
It'd still be blowing in, like a warm southern whisper on her

>>>My Kinda Party Jason Aldean
<sos>
I worked all week
Cleaned up clean cut and clean shaved
I got the cover off the '68
I fire it up and let them horses sing
A little pretty thing
A little tan-legged Georgia dream
She’s a rocking them holey jeans
Baby what you got going on Saturday?
You know words got it there’s gonna be a party
Out of town about half a mile
Four wheel drives and big mud tires
Oh baby you can find me
In the back of a jacked up tailgate
Sitting round watching all these pretty things
Get down in that Georgia clay
And I’ll find peace
At the bottom of a real tall cold drink
I'm chilling to some Skynyrd and some old Hank
Let's get this thing started
It’s my kinda party
If you wanna drink
Go baby just do your thing
Give up your keys
Hell why drive when you can stay with me?
And then after while we’ll sneak away from the bonfire
Walk by the moonlight and down to the riverside
Gotcha sipping on some moonshine
Baby if you're in the mood you can settle for a one night rodeo
You can be my tan-legged Juliet
I’ll be your Redneck Romeo
Oh baby you can find me
In the back of a jacked up tailgate
Sitting round watching all these pretty things
Get down in that Georgia clay
And I’ll find peace
At the bottom of a real tall cold drink
I'm chilling to some Skynyrd and some old Hank
Let's get this thing started
It’s my kinda party
Oh baby you can find me

>>>Night Train Jason Aldean
<sos>
I've been thinking 'bout you all day, baby
Waitin' on that sun to go down
What ya say I pick you up after work?
Slide over, we slip out to the outskirts of town
I got a blanket and a fifth of Comfort
A little something to knock off the edge
It's supposed to get a little cool tonight
Looks like I'm gonna have to hold you tight, yeah
About a mile off Old Mill Road
In that spot nobody knows
We park the truck and we take off runnin'
Hurry up, girl, I hear it comin'
Got a moon and a billion stars
The sound of steel and old boxcars
The thought of you's drivin' me insane
Come on, baby, let's go listen to the night train
Yeah, I hope it's gonna be a long one
And if we're lucky, it's moving slow
I wouldn't mind if it lasted all night
Lying next to you on that hillside, let's go
About a mile off Old Mill Road
In that spot nobody knows
We park the truck and we take off runnin'
Hurry up, girl, I hear it comin'
Got a moon and a billion stars
The sound of steel and old boxcars
The thought of you is drivin' me insane
Come on, baby, let's go listen to the night train

>>>The Only Way I Know Jason Aldean
<sos>
Well, I grew up in one of them old farm towns
Where they hit it hard 'til the sun goes down
Nobody really seemed to care
That we were living in the middle of nowhere
We just figured that's how it was
And everybody else was just like us
Soaking in the rain, baking in the sun
Don't quit 'til the job gets done
That's the only way I know
Don't stop 'til everything's gone
Straight ahead, never turn around
Don't back up, don't back down
A full throttle, wide open
You get tired and you don't show it
Dig a little deeper when you think you can't dig no more
That's the only way I know
That old red dirt, the first thing you learn
Is you don't get nothing that you don't earn
Humble pride I grew up on
You find out just how bad you want it
The sun in our eyes and backs to the fences
We didn't know the odds were against us
Hit the wall smoking and spinning
Still wasn't thinking 'bout nothing but winning
That's the only way I know
Don't stop 'til everything's gone
Straight ahead, never turn around
Don't back up, don't back down
A full throttle, wide open
You get tired and you don't show it
Dig a little deeper when you think you can't dig no more
That's the only way I know
Maybe there's another path that
Will get you there a little bit faster
But I'm sticking with the one inside of me
That's the only way I know
Don't stop 'til everything's gone
Straight ahead, never turn around
Don't back up, don't back down
A full throttle, wide open
You get tired and you don't show it
Dig a little deeper when you think you can't dig no more
That's the only way I—
That's the only way I know
But don't stop 'til everything's gone
Straight ahead, never turn around
Don't back up, don't back down
A full throttle, wide open
You get tired and you don't show it
Dig a little deeper when you think you can't dig no more
That's the only way I know
The only way I know
Now get on it one time
<eos>
>>>Rearview Town Jason Aldean
<sos>
Wiped the footprints off my dash
Tore up those sun-faded photographs
Threw 'em in the wind, ya'll can have it back
I stuck my middle finger up in the sky
Flipped off that "Y'all come back" sign
Looked in the mirror one last time
And watched it disappear
It ain't nothin' but a rearview town
Broken hearts and rusted plows
Roots ripped right up out of the ground
Never thought I'd ever leave it
It ain't nothin' what it used to be
On the other side of that dust cloud
Ain't nothin' but a rearview town
I could tough it out, but what's the use?
A place that small, it's hard to do
Too much of her to run into
And so much road to somewhere new
It ain't nothin' but a rearview town
Broken hearts and rusted plows
Roots ripped right up out of the ground
Never thought I'd ever leave it
It ain't nothin' what it used to be
On the other side of that dust cloud
Ain't nothin' but a rearview town
It ain't nothin' but yesterday
One less truck rollin' down Main
Ain't nothin' left to say
It ain't nothin' what it used to be
On the other side of that dust cloud
Ain't nothin' but a rearview town
Ain't nothin' but a rearview town

>>>Relentless Jason Aldean
<sos>
I toss and turn, I'm losing sleep
Can't seem to make any sense of anything
I keep wandering around in circles, in a daze
Just when I start awakening
I find that something's intoxicating me
'Til I'm tangled up, lost inside a maze
I can't outrun it
Girl, your love is
Just like the waves against the sand
Over and over and time and time again
Your love keeps on reaching out to me
I can't outrun it
Girl, your love is
I can't fight it
Girl, your love is
I'm staring at a hurricane
A hundred miles of driving rain
I just smile and lean into the wind
'Cause I can't outrun it
I can't outrun it
Girl, your love is
I can't fight it
Girl, your love is
I toss and turn, I'm losing sleep
Can't seem to make any sense of anything
I keep wandering around in circles, in a daze
Just when I start awakening
I find that something's intoxicating me
'Til I'm tangled up, lost inside a maze

>>>She's Country Jason Aldean
<sos>
You boys ever met a real country girl
Talkin', true blue, out in the woods, down-home, country girl
She's a hot little number in her pickup truck
Daddy's sweet money done jacked it up
She's a party all-nighter from South Carolina
A bad mamajama from down in Alabama
She's a ragin' cajun, a lunatic from Brunswick
Juicy Georgia Peach with a thick southern drawl
Sexy swing and walk, brother, she's all
From her cowboy boots to her down home roots
From the songs she plays to the prayers she prays
That's the way she was born and raised
She ain’t afraid to stay
A hell raisin' sugar when the sun goes down
Mama taught her how to rip up the town
Honey drippin' honey from the holler in Kentucky
Get you flippin', kinda trippy like a Mississippi hippie
She's a Kansas princess
Crazy mother trucker, undercover lover
Thick southern drawl, sexy swing and walk
From her cowboy boots to her down home roots
From the songs she plays to the prayers she prays
That's the way she was born and raised
She ain’t afraid to stay
From her cowboy boots to her down home roots
From the songs she plays to the prayers she prays
That's the way she was born and raised
She ain't afraid to stay
Yeah, she's nothin' but country
She's all about the country
From the backwoods, she's a homegrown, down to the bone

Holding me to hold me back
Around your door she's calling out my name
I come in at 5 AM
And she is waiting for me
She said, "Where have you been?", I said, "I was out!"
She said, "You're no good cause you're running without love"
And I'm going straight to hell
Just like my momma said
I'm going straight to hell 
I'm going straight to hell
Just like my momma said
I'm going straight to hell
Oh and I'm gonna burn it down, baby
The black widow and the ladies man
Met down at the laundromat
And tried to make me understand
And just then, her mother bursts in
And said, "You're the son of that bitch in the wind
Get out of my house and hit the road"
And I kept falling like a Rolling Stones' song
'Cause I'm going straight to hell
Just like my momma said
I'm going straight to hell 
I'm going straight to hell
Just like my momma said
I'm going straight to hell
The stars came out and warned me so
As I walked on down the road
Fifty bucks and a suitcase steered me clear
She took my hand as we walked into the sun
A new day's promise had just begun
We'll make it alone whether you like it or not
And I turned around and shouted "Help me momma!"
'Cause I'm going straight to hell
Just like my momma said
I'm going straight to hell
Oh yeah, I'm going straight to hell
Ooh just like my momma said
I'm going straight to hell
(Oh Lord help us
Yeah I'll bring the whiskey boys
Y'all taking me with ya
Help me Jesus, help me Jesus, we all are

Bailing some hay and stackin' it all up
Can't wait for the sun to go down
Roll into town, shine the old truck up
Swing by the Quick Stop
Grab a couple rocky tops
Then ease on out your way
To your place around eight o'clock
Well, I'm just ready to ride this Chevy
Ride this Chevy down a little back road
Slide your pretty little self on over
Get a little closer, turn up the radio
Put your pretty pink toes on the dash
Lean the seat back
Man, I swear there ain't nothin' looks better than that
Sweet tan little thing with nothin' to do
I wanna take a little ride with you
I hope you're wearing those frayed out cut-offs
Makes me want to get lost out in the moonlight
Drop the tailgate down on a turn road
Watch the corn grow, baby, that's a good night
Anyone from the heartland is gonna understand
What I am talking about right now
Ain't no doubt, we got a game plan
Well, I'm just ready to ride this Chevy

>>>Tattoos on This Town Jason Aldean

There's still black marks on that county road
Where we drag raced our pick-ups and Mustangs
And weathered all the sun and rain
And to this day up on that overpass
Even underneath the new paint, you can still see
"Allie, will you marry me?"
Take a ride, look around
There ain't no doubt
It sure left its mark on us, we sure left our mark on it
We let the world know we were here with everything we did
We laid a lot of memories down, like tattoos on this town
There's still a rope burn on that old branch, that hangs over the river
I still got the scar
From swinging out a little too far
There ain't a corner of this hallow ground
That we don't laughed or cried on
It's where we loved, lived and learned real life stuff
It's everything we're made of
It sure left its mark on us, we sure left our mark on it
We let the world know we were here with everything we did
We laid a lot of memories down, like tattoos on this town
Like tattoos on this town
Everywhere, there we are
It hits me right in my heart
It sure left its mark on us, we sure left our mark on it
We let the world know we were here with everything we did
We laid a lot of memories down
And we'll always be hanging around
Like tattoos on this town

>>>That's What Tequila Does Jason Aldean

It don't take too much
To get the wheels turnin' round and round in my head
Top shelf or Cuervo
I know it's gonna stir up every memory she left
Still burns, I can't lie
When I think about the good before goodbye
Guess that's what I'm drinkin' on tonight
It'll make you think that you got a shot at the one that got away when it goes down
She's gonna tell you, she's gonna come back and that's what makes you stay for another round
Keep you stickin' around, keep pourin' out
Until she's all you thinking 'bout
It'll keep you hung up, keep you drunk on what it was
Man, that's what tequila does
It sneaks up on you
Goin' out for one turns into 2AM
You know what's next, get you lookin' for a text
Get you checkin' your phone again
Make you stay all night, it'll give you a million reasons why
It'll make you think that you got a shot at the one that got away when it goes down
She's gonna tell you, she's gonna come back and that's what makes you stay for another round
Keep you stickin' around, keep pourin' out
Until she's all you thinking 'bout
It'll keep you hung up, keep you drunk on what it was

They call us a two lane just passing by slow down town
Yeah they say what's there to do when you ain't got nothin' around
Just a few street lights, speed limit signs that all say 25
But those folks ain't lived in our lives
They ain't seen the blood sweat and tears
It took to live their dreams
When everything's on the line
Ain't just another field, just another farm
Naw, it's the ground we grew up on
They think it's a middle of nowhere place where we take it slow
Aw, but they don't know
All they see is tractors, barbwire and tall green grass
Naw they don't see the years spent working, busting their ass
How they pray for rain
They don't know a thing
About what it takes
They ain't seen the blood sweat and tears
It took to live their dreams
When everything's on the line
Ain't just another field, just another farm
Naw, it's the ground we grew up on
They think it's a middle of nowhere place where we take it slow

Sitting back behind that moon
It goes perfect with your eyes

It's something about the way you're smiling
Making the stars fall right on queue

Tonight looks good on you
I can taste the midnight on your lips
Makes me just wanna lean in for another kiss
Wind blowing your hair around

>>>The Truth Jason Aldean

Tell 'em all I'm on vacation
Say I went to visit friends
That you ain't heard or seen from me in quite a while
When they ask you where I've been
Tell 'em I'm out on the West Coast
Where it don't ever rain
And that I'm probably doing fine
Just don't tell 'em I've gone crazy
That I'm still strung out over you
Tell 'em anything you want to
Just don't tell 'em all the truth
Yeah, don't tell 'em all the truth
Tell 'em all I'm out in Vegas
Blowing every dollar I ever made
Tell 'em that I must be into something bad for me
'Cause I sure lost a lot of weight
Tell 'em I'm out on the road
With some old rock and roll band
Living like a gypsy king
Just don't tell 'em I've gone crazy
That I'm still strung out over you
Tell 'em anything you want to
Just don't tell 'em all the truth
Yeah, don't tell 'em all the truth
The truth is that I'm asking you to lie

Sucker punch somebody on a sidewalk
Carjack an old lady at a red light
Pull a gun on the owner of a liquor store
Ya think it's cool, well, act a fool if ya like
Cuss out a cop, spit in his face
Stomp on the flag and light it up
Yeah, ya think you're tough
Well, try that in a small town
See how far ya make it down the road
'Round here, we take care of our own
You cross that line, it won't take long

Try that in a small town
Got a gun that my granddad gave me
They say one day they're gonna round up
Well, that shit might fly in the city, good luck
Try that in a small town

'Round here, we take care of our own

Where's the guy in the steel toes covered in dirt?
Just a rock n' roll T-shirt, headed to work
With a pack of Red Man in his pocket
He's kind of red, man, but he's rockin'
Wears a beat up Tele' and a Marshall stack
Little Marshall Tucker and a six pack
Where's the good ol' boys and the good ol' days?
Straight up gettin' sideways
We back, we back, we back in the speakers
Back in black, getting blasted in the bleachers
It's probably true what my mama said
I do it just like my daddy did
We back, we back, we back in the saddle
Back on stage making the whole place rattle
Back with the A-team, train on the track
Thought we were gone but you're wrong, now it's on, we back
Where's the chick wearin' blue jeans a little too tight?
Got a grip on a koozie if it's what she likes
Getting picked up in a pickup
And kickin' it with guys like us
We back, we back, we back in the speakers
Back in black, getting blasted in the bleachers
It's probably true what my mama said
I do it just like my daddy did
We back, we back, we back in the saddle
Back on stage making the whole place rattle
Back with the A-team, train on the track
Thought we were gone but you're wrong, now it's on, we back
Sun comes up and sun goes down, yeah
Everything good comes back around
We back, we back

Back in black, getting blasted in the bleachers

>>>When She Says Baby Jason Aldean

Some days it's tough just gettin' up
Throwin' on these boots and makin' that climb
Some days I would rather be a no show or lay low
'Fore I go out of my mind
But when she says baby 
Oh, no matter what comes, ain't goin' nowhere
She runs her fingers through my hair
And saves me 
Yeah, that look in her eye's got me comin' alive
And drivin' me a good kind of crazy
When she says baby
Oh, when she says baby
Some nights I come home fightin' mad
Feel like runnin' my fist through the wall
Is it even worth what I'm fightin' for anymore?
Feelin' torn, aw, to hell with it all
But when she says baby 
Oh, no matter what comes, ain't goin' nowhere
She runs her fingers through my hair
And saves me 
Yeah, that look in her eye's got me comin' alive
And drivin' me a good kind of crazy
When she says baby
Everything gon' be alright
Just lay down by my side
Let me love you through this life
Yeah, she's a perfect shot of faith
When every bit of mine is gone
Somethin' I can believe in, a best friend
A Heaven-sent love to lean on
But when she says baby 
Oh, no matter what comes, ain't goin' nowhere
She runs her fingers through my hair
And saves me 
Yeah, that look in her eye's got me comin' alive
And drivin' me a good kind of crazy

>>>Why Jason Aldean

It's 3:00 a.m. and I finally say
I'm sorry for actin' that way
I didn't really mean to make you cry
Oh, baby, sometimes I wonder why
Does it always have to come down to you leavin'
Before I'll say "I love you"?
Why do I always use the words that cut the deepest
When I know how much it hurts you?
Oh, baby, why do I do that to you?
I know I'd never let you walk away
So why do I push you 'til you break?
And why are you always on the verge of goodbye
Before I'll show you how I really feel inside?
Why does it always have to come down to you leavin'
Before I'll say "I love you"?
And why do I always use the words that cut the deepest
When I know how much it hurts you?
Oh, baby, why do I do that to you?
Why do I do that to you?
Why do I always use the words that cut the deepest
When I know how much it hurts you?
Oh, baby, why do I do that to you?

Like a rainy Sunday mornin'
Makes me wanna stay in bed twisted up all day long
You're my inspiration, girl
You take me places, put the words right into these songs
Stealin' kisses under cover, babe
See forever when I see your face
And I swear God made you for me
You make it easy lovin' up on you
Make it easy with every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my savin' grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy
You took all my rough around the edges
Never let it ruffle up your feathers, angel
Yeah, I'm down for life, you got me wrapped around your finger
And I like it just in case you can't tell
You make it easy lovin' up on you
Make it easy with every little thing you do
You're my sunshine in the darkest days
My better half, my savin' grace
You make me who I wanna be
You make it easy
Stealin' kisses under cover, babe
See forever when I see your face

>>>Afilando Los Cuchillos Bad Bunny
<sos>
Dale, estamos afilando las navajas, dale
Llegó  el afilador de navajas
Ha llegado el afilador a su domicilio, a la puerta de su casa
Se afila el cuchillo, el afilador en su propio domicilio
Llegó  la hora de un combo de miles en motoras
Patrullando  las 24 horas, boricua de cora'
Con el puño arriba, a la conquista
No  nos va a meter las cabras un pendejo de Marista
Según este compadre, mi ma'i junto con to'as las mujere'
Son igual de putas que su madre
Tú no eres hijo del cañaveral, escoria
Tú  eres hijo del cabrón más corrupto de la historia
Pero al igual que Ricky, estoy liberando las tensiones
Le doy fuego a la Fortaleza como se supone
Y al otro día voy a la iglesia pa' que me perdonen
Mejor no quieras probar de qué estamos hechos
Aquí en El Monte heredamos el mismo pecho
Tus disculpas se ahogan con el agua de la lluvia
En las casas que todavía no tienen techo
Tú no heredaste pecho, tú heredaste un patrimonio
Y a ti por la noche te persiguen los demonios
En la familia que mataste, destruiste un matrimonio
Esto va por Lilliam y su hijo Juan Antonio
Esto va pa' que despiertes
Esto va por las cuatro mil seiscientas cuarenta y cinco muertes
La hipocresía del país en general
Tirar piedra' en Venezuela está bien, pero en Puerto Rico está mal
Esto va pa' los artistas internacionales:
¿Y las banderitas de Puerto Rico en las redes sociales?
Ninguno de nosotros los supuestos bandoleros
Está acusa'o de fraude, robo o lavado de dinero
Con todo lo que han roba'o estos politiqueros
Pintamos las paredes del Caribe entero
Y aunque esto no le caiga bien a la gente
Pa' decírtelo en un chat, pa' eso lo digo de frente
Se tiran a los caseríos, a los puntos 'e droga
Les rompen las casas y por ellos nadie aboga
Nosotros hacemos lo mismo sin delicadeza
A estos criminales le' hacemos una redada en Fortaleza
Si el pueblo entero quiere que te vayas, caradura
Y tú te quedas, entonces estamos en dictadura
Solo te apoya tu esposa, la exmodelo
La que piensa que Cien Años de Soledad la escribió Coelho
Y así son los pocos que te siguen, brutos
Pero tranqui', afilar navajas toma un minuto
Somos el rugido de la bandera de Puertorro con todos sus tejidos
Exigiendo tu renuncia, pa' que nadie salga herido
To' el mundo unido, no importa el color de tu partido
Esto salió temprano pa' que te lo desayunes
La furia es el único partido que nos une
Vamo' cortante' como lo' cuchillo'
Sacando chispa hasta llegar al filo
Hay que arrancar la maleza del plantío
Pa' que ninguno se aproveche de lo mío
El pueblo no aguanta más injusticia'
Se cansó de tus mentira' y de que manipulen las noticia'
Ey, ey, to' los combo', los caserío', somos nuestra milicia
Ya no nos coges de pendejo
Eres un corrupto que de corruptos coges consejo'
Arranca pa'l carajo y vete lejo'
Y denle la bienvenida a la generación del "Yo no me dejo"
Y quizás tú hablas en tu grupo como yo en el mío
Pero yo no tengo fondos públicos escondí'os
De la muerte de los puertorriqueños yo no me río
P.R. está encabrona'o, Ricky estás jodí'o
Y que se enteren to's los continente'
Que Ricardo Rosselló es un incompetente
A ti nadie te quiere, ni tu propia gente
Vamo' a prender en fuego a tu gabinete
Los títeres, guarden las cortas y saquen los machetes
La cuna de las crías, con el boricua nadie se mete
To'as las paredes dicen "Ricky, vete", ey
Y no es vandalismo
Vandalismo es que nos tiremo' nosotros mismo'
Por defender a los que nos llevaron al abismo
Vandalismo es que siempre voten por los mismo'
Y se roben to's los chavos de educación
Mientras cierran escuelas y los niños no tienen salón
Ey, es hora de sacar las rata'
Que se vaya Ricky, que se vaya el otro, que se vaya Tata
Y no se trata de hablar malo en las conversaciones
Malo hablo yo en mi casa y en to'as mis canciones
Se trata de que le has mentí'o al pueblo con cojones
De que encondiste las muertes con to' y los vagones
Y te burlaste de nosotros con otros cabrones
E hiciste que el país entero se encojone
Ricky, renuncia y a tu ma'i que te perdone
Yo no; yo no
Vamo' cortante' como lo' cuchillo'
Sacando chispa hasta llegar al filo
Hay que arrancar la maleza del plantío
Pa' que ninguno se aproveche de lo mío
Vamo' cortante' como lo' cuchillo'
Sacando chispa hasta llegar al filo
Hay que arrancar la maleza del plantío
Pa' que ninguno se aproveche de lo mío

Al fin y al cabo, esta vida es mía, mía
Salí con el corazón partido y no quiero na'

Estoy soltera, hago lo que quiera y nadie levanta mi falda
Sin antes era mala
Ahora viene la nueva versión y más mala
Después yo veo que gustico llevo a mi cama
Que vivir de amores, eso ya no me hace falta
Yo soy dueña de mi vida, a mí nadie me manda
Me va mucho mejor así soltero 
Jangueo, bebo, fumo, hago to' lo que yo quiero
No me hables de amor verdadero

Como en la playa cuando se te mete entre las nalgas arena
Un baile con cosas obscenas
Que cuando nos mire la gente, les dé vergüenza ajena
Hasta abajo sin pena
Que se nos olvide que no hemos cobra'o la quincena
Química de la buena, conectado' como las hormiga', pero sin antenas
Mueve ese culei de bomba y plena
Cortaron a Elena, pero nadie nos frena
No somos de Hollywood, pero dominamos la escena
Hasta de espalda la goleamos, una chilena
Hoy nadie nos ordena, sólo este general cuando suena
Como entrando por la puerta de un iglú; doblando rodillas
Como una culebrilla con piernas; resbala zapatillas
Como que el piso esta embarra'o con mantequilla
Azúcar por la vena con jeringuilla
Lo que traigo es chocolate con vainilla
Con mi música tú brillas
En este mundo somos tú y yo y después van las siete maravillas
Pa' los que están senta'os, llegó la pesadilla
Con medio pocillo pongo a perrear hasta a las silla'
Con este dembow les quito el hambre
Se habían olvida'o de que tengo a White Lion en la sangre

Los shot' de tequila ni lo' siente 
Ahora ve la vida diferente
Buena, pero le gustan delincuente'
La baby llega y se siente la presión 
Ella ni trata y llama la atención 
Ey, el perreo e' su profesión 
Siempre puesta pa' la misión

Marihuana y bebida, gozándose la vida como es
Se dejó hace poco y tiene vida nueva 
Anda con una amiga que e' como su jeva 
Que le trajo 512 pa' que se las beba
Ella es calla'íta, no es que no se atreva
Si hay sol, hay playa, si hay playa, hay alcohol
Si hay alcohol, hay sexo, si es contigo, mejor
Si hay sol, hay playa, si hay playa, hay alcohol
Si hay alcohol, hay sexo, si es contigo, mejor
Quítate la ropa que hace calor
Días de playa, noche' de terror
En la gaveta dejó el temor
Pa' las envidiosa', paz y amor
Bad Bunny, baby, bebé
Ella es callaíta', pero pa'l sexo e' atrevida, yo sé

Ella no era así, ella no era así, no sé quién la dañó
Ella no era así, ella no era así, no sé quién la dañó, pero
(Alócate y hazte mía
Que la noche lo pidió, el destino lo decidió
Ya sé que sentías lo mismo que yo y todavía
Nos queda un ratito para formar el escándalo
A menos que no te decidas)

>>>La Canción Bad Bunny
<sos>
Pensaba que te había olvida'o, eh
Pero pusieron la canción, eh, eh, eh
Que cantamo’ bien borracho'
Que bailamo' bien borracho’
Nos besamo' bien borracho' los dos
Pensaba que te había olvida'o, eh
Pero pusieron la canción, eh, eh, eh
Que cantamo' bien borracho'
Que bailamo' bien borracho'
Nos besamo’ bien borracho’ los dos
Pensaba que te había olvida'o
Que por comerme a do’ o diez, te olvidaría' 
Cogí un respiro y me salí de la vía
Y como un pendejo, no sabía lo que hacía
Nunca lo superé, nunca te superé 
Hasta me aprendí to'a la' balada’ en inglé' 
Respiré y conté hasta tres 
Ere' la fantasía oscura de Kanye West, bebé, ey
Hace tiempo lo barato me salió caro 
Yo sólo twitteo, bala' loca' disparo 
¿Cómo olvidar la bellaquera en el carro?
¿A que guió solo?
Pensaba que te había' olvida'o , yeh
Pero pusieron la canción, yeh, yeh
Que cantamos bien borrachos
Que bailamo' bien borrachos
Nos besamo' bien borracho' lo' dos
Pensaba que te había' olvida'o, eh
Pero pusieron la canción, yeh, yeh
Que cantamo' bien borracho'
Que bailamo' bien borracho'
Nos besamo' bien borracho' los dos, ey, ey
Y hace tiempo que no venía' a mi cabeza
Pero ya van par de cerveza'
Y me acordé de cómo tú me besa'
De to' lo' polvo' encima 'e la mesa
Y en el carro, la playa, y el motel
En casa de tu pai', cuando yo te iba a ver
Las vece' que tu mai' no' llegó a coger
Tú brincando mojaíta', sudando Chanel
Yo sé que lo nuestro e' cosa de ayer
Y me pone contento que te va bien con él
Yo ni te extrañaba ni te quería ver
Pero pusieron la canción que te gustaba poner
Y me acordé de ti, cuando me hiciste feliz
Se acabó, pues, me fui, ey
Yo mismo me río de mí porque—
Pensaba que te había' olvida'o, eh
Pero pusieron la canción, yeh, yeh
Que cantamos bien borrachos
Que bailamo' bien borrachos
Nos besamo' bien borracho' lo' do'
Y yo pensaba que tu nombre estaba muerto, eh
Pero te soñé despierto, ey
Hoy salí pa' la calle suelto
Sin sentimiento', el corazón desierto
Y yo pensaba que tu nombre estaba muerto
Pero te soñé despierto
Hoy salí pa' la calle sueltoSin sentimiento', el corazón desierto

Siente lo que siento yo
Derritiendo el frío porque vengo con mi gente
De la tierra son las estrella' y del cielo son los pionero'
De las nubes salen los fuego', los que no se apagan con hielo
Quien le tiene miedo al sereno no resiste ni un aguacero
Báilalo, que esto está bueno, muévelo, que esto es un juego
No quiero un trofeo gigante
Como Héctor, yo lo que quiero es que mi gente cante
Hoy no nos paran ni con tranquilizante de elefante
El dinero, aunque sea abundante, no vale
Aquí todo' somo' importante'
Con el mismo semblante, suda'o y sin bañar
Esa cadera mírala cómo cocina
Gourmet como bacalao sin espina'
Llovió y esto no se ha acaba'o
Bailamo' hasta con los zapato' moja'os
La' cara' linda' que lindas son
Pa' esa sonrisa un besito 'e bombón
Corazón de melón, melón
Agarra tu pareja antes de que suene el trombón
Lo baila la calle
Que cante mi gente
Lo baila la calle
Que cante mi gente
Lo baila la calle
Que cante mi gente
Lo baila la calle
Que lo baile San Juan, que lo baile La Habana
Apreta'íto y bien suda'o como en Copacabana
Que mala ere' Juliana
Demasia'o de sabrosura como pa' no verte mañana
Con los pies caliente' y la cerveza fría
Deja que el alma monte la coreografía
Que yo tampoco sé bailar, pero confía 
Que aprendo antes que salga la luz del día 
Muévete como tu bandera
El tiempo pasa y por nadie espera
La calle está prendí'a, está en candela
Bailando sin zapato' con los pie' acapella
Con orgullo te digo dónde está mi abuela
Gracias Maelo y Lavoe por la escuela
Que cante mi gente, le' prendo' una vela
Con Cristo mirando toda' las favela', yeh
Lo baila la calle
Que cante mi gente
Lo baila la calle
Que cante mi gente
Lo baila la calle

La brisa y el viento no paran de soplar

Juntes así de grandes sólamente pasan cada 10 años en la música
Yo necesito verte 
Será la magia que tienen tus ojos
Y esos truquitos para enamorar
Tú me seduces a tu antojo
Y de tu hechizo no puedo escapar 
Qué ganas tengo de buscarte
Y de volverte a besar
Por más que traten de alejarte
Baby, conmigo tú te vas
Escápate conmigo esta noche, bebé
Te quiero comer , te va a encantar 
Tú sabes que conmigo siempre la pasas bien 
Te quiero comer, tus labios besar
Bebé, no digas que no, oh
Si sólo somos tú y yo, oh
Y se te eriza la piel
Cuando entramos en calor
Bebé, no digas que no 
Si sólo somos tú y yo
Si se te eriza la piel
Cuando entramos en calor 
Yo quiero que conmigo tú te escape' 
Tu mejor amiga que te tape 
Dime qué botella quieres que destape 
Sin condón, contigo yo me voy acape
Es que me gusta tu totito cuando late 
Pa' ti no tengo un phillie, tengo un bate 
Con la corta pa' que tu jevo ni trate 
Si pregunta dile que yo soy tu cuate, yeh
Conmigo los domingos son en Palomino 
Botellas de champaña o copas de vino 
Chanel, Louis Vuitton, Gucci o Valentino 
Alexander McQueen o Moschino 
Me gusta verte en cuatro, no apagues la luz 
Que hoy te vo' a sacar el jugo como un Bubbaloo
Tu jevo está atrasa'o, parece un Razer con bluetooth
Pues no te complace, eso lo dijiste tú 
Quiero que conmigo te escapes 
Y que con besos me mates
Que con caricias me maltrates 
El magnate , dentro de un yate 
Y tú bailando empapada en chocolate
Dale baby, toma la decisión
Y sólo aprieta el botón 
Tú sabes, el de la seducción 
Alto por ciento de pasión
Tráeme el aceite pa'l masaje y se fue la tensión
No tengas miedo, te toco porque puedo 
Algo me pasa cuando contigo me enredo 
Se chupa los dedos y yo no retrocedo
Tú me dices si nos escapamos y procedo
Escápate conmigo esta noche, bebé
Te quiero comer , te va a encantar 
Tú sabes que conmigo siempre la pasas bien 
Te quiero comer, tus labios besar 
Si te escapas conmigo será otra historia 
Momentos inolvidables en tu memoria 
No hagas caso a comentarios ni a la escoria
Vuela conmigo, ven te invito a saborear la gloria
You, contigo me saque la loto'
Eres caliente, en tu mirada lo noto 
Tu cuerpo es la nave
Y en este caso especial, yo vengo siendo el piloto 
En el espacio de tu ser me quiero perder 
Y aprender todos los secretos que esconde tu piel 
Quisiera ver contigo un nuevo amanecer
No en la tierra, sino en el aire a 30 mil pies 
Atrévete, yo voy a ti, deja la timidez
Y vas a ver cómo de nuevo querrás otra vez 
Asómate por la ventana y dime qué ves 
Sólo nubes blancas y una vida sin estrés
Ok, que tal si baby yo te busco en el A. Romeo 
Que tengo medio phillie ya en el cenicero 
Relájate, que te acaricien lo' asiento' de cuero 
Te hablo claro, tú sabes que yo te soy sincero 
Te veo triste y también un poco perdida 
Será por los problemas que has pasado en tu vida 
Escápate conmigo, vacaciones extendidas 
Pa' recorrer el mundo desde Egipto a Argentina 
No quiero que esto vaya a terminar 
Quiero que te quedes un poquito más 
Tú eres algo que yo no puedo olvidar 
Y contigo yo me vuelvo a escapar
Escápate conmigo esta noche, bebé
Te quiero comer, tus labios besar
Tú sabes que conmigo siempre la pasas bien
Te quiero comer , tus labios besar 
Ya me cansé de pensarte en mi cama 
Hoy voy a buscarte pa' matar las ganas 
Tu cuerpo y tu alma me llama 
Me tiran la mala porque la que no gana, siempre difama
Tú sabes cual es la meta 
Yo soy el único que entiende to' lo que tu cuerpo interpreta 
Vivimos jugando en una ruleta
Pero por ti lo dejo to' y me pongo a buscarte por to' el planeta
Yo estoy loco con tu foto y como si fuera poco 
Sabes que de ti soy el piloto
Ni tú, ni yo tiene el corazón roto 
No estamo' enamora'o, pero na' más quiere conmigo y no con otro 
Porque antes era inútil como un iPhone 7 que no tiene el chip
Quieren hundirme el barco en el que vamo' juntos
Y yo que soy un experto en el Battleship 
Soy un player, tú eres mi championship
Quiero comerte to' los días, tenemos un partnership
Que nadie se meta más que dañe la relationship
Hoy me vestí de blanco, todo blanco pa' ti 
Me bañé del perfume que te gusta, Clive Chris
Escápate conmigo y quítate la ropa que desnudos vamo' a grabar un feat 
Escápate conmigo esta noche, bebé 
Te quiero comer , te va a encantar 
Tú sabes que conmigo siempre la pasas bien 
Te quiero comer, tus labios besar 
Escucha bien, princesa, sólo ten una decisión
Tú das la aprobación y yo ejecuto

Fumando como Snoop Dogg y Wiz Kha
Las gatas quieren Kush, no quieren Friska
Prendí un bastón como el de la brisca
2 phillies, se queda bizca
Lo que tú estás haciendo yo lo hice primero
Bebé, ese novio tuyo es medio culero
Yo ando por New York con un par de cueros
Y pila e' cuarto pa' to's estos cabrones hacerles fiero
Yo tengo agricultores como Piculín
Los ojos rojos como el Chapulín
Hoy se me olvido beberme la Ritalin

Las libras yo las compro y llegan por FedEx
Priority el paquete, next day vía express
Del celular traqueo con el GPS
Y el shipping se lo cobramo' al bobo de tu ex
Que tiene un guille de bichote y lo que fuma es regular
Sintéticas de esas que venden por ahí en los puestos legal
Que le baja a la movie, que pa' acá no venga a frontear
Que somos millonarios, y acabo 'e comprar par de acres pa' sembrar
Baby to's estos cabrones me quieren matar
La vida es una y la tengo que aprovechar
No sé si esto es un sueño o será real

Nosotros tenemos la corona del Trap, cabrones
A ella no le gusta el reggaetón
Pero le encanta cómo canta la sensación 
No fue mi intención 
Quedarme con to'a la atención
Vivo en una mansión y no me sé ni la dirección 
Está cabrón, muy cabrón
Papi Arca, pídanme la bendición , prra
Joder , mi casa es un hotel y se ve cabrona la vista 
En ella puedo aterrizar un avión, solo me falta la pista 
Imposible que falle esta combinación , de flow una ensalada mixta 
Palomo, no insista', cuando se habla de grandеza no estás en la lista
Los desmonto como Legoland 
Y si yo te señalo los míos te los dan 
Y vas pa' dentro, pero de la van
Del cuello pa'rriba hace mucho frío 
Yo llego y cae nieve en el caserío 
Dejando sin regalo' a estos malparíos'
Santa Claus con la esencia del Grinch metío' 
Y yo la vi, anda con do', la amiga me miró
Al VIP se pegó, claro que sí, claro que entró
Hola, mi nombre es Arcángel, un gusto, un placer
Hoy tú te va' con una leyenda que no va a volver a nacer, no 
Y ya la vi, anda con do', la amiga me miró
Al VIP se pegó, claro que sí, claro que entró
Hola, jaja, mi nombre es Bad Bunny, un gusto, un placer
Aprovéchame hoy, que obliga'o no me vuelve' a ver 
Tu baby quiere que la rompa , je
Luka, stepback, la jumpa 
Tú estás loco por vender el alma, pero ni el diablo te la compra 
Yo no tengo compe , pregúntaselo a tu compa 
To' el mundo ya sabe, por eso Bad Bunny ni ronca 
A mí me escuchan los abuelo' y sus nietecito' maleante' 
Tiradore' y estudiante', doctore' y gánster'
Naturale' y con implante', los adulto' y los infante'
En Barcelona y Alicante , en Santurce y Almirante 
Cruzando la calle con los Beatle'
Damian Lillard y otro buzzer beater 
El que quiera, que me tire
Otra cosa es que yo mire, nah, nah, nah, ja
Yo soy un pitcher, yo soy un pitcher, ey

Vengo de PR, tierra de Clemente, a mí sin cojone' me tienen to' lo' Jeter , ey

Estoy ocupado haciendo dinero
So no tengo tiempo pa' cuidar mis hijo', que ninguno cobra más de lo que cobra la babysitter, jeje
Papi, vámono' ya, quiero chingar
Okey, okey, dame un break, mami, ja 
Te escupo la boca, te jalo el pelo
Te doy con el bicho y con el lelo
En el jet privado, un polvo en el cielo
Hoy quiero una puta, una modelo, ey 
Ah, mami, chapéame, no me molesta, je
Que despué' yo te voy a romper con el néctar 
Y ya le di a los do', la amiga repitió
Wow, qué rico me lo mamó, en la boca de la otra se la echó

No estaba esperando nada
De encontrarme contigo anoche
Solo era una más
Una noche linda, algo especial
Pero algo está tan diferente
Todo alrededor me gira de repente
Tú y yo cambió en singular
Sin miedo, papito, ven y dame más
Ven sin miedo, sin barullo
No te cierres a este mundo
Fluye ahora, ven conmigo
Y ven acá, amor, ven acá
Ven acá y déjame entrar
Ven acá, amor, ven acá
Ven acá y déjame entrar
Lo siento, bebé 
No trates de enamorarme o no te hago coro 
Hace tiempo que de nadie yo no me enamoro 
Y estoy puesto pa' uste', pa' hacerlo otra ve', pero mi tiempo e' oro
Yo por nadie me ajoro
Lo siento, bebé 
No trates de enamorarme o no te hago coro 
Hace tiempo que de nadie yo no me enamoro 
Y estoy puesto pa' uste', pa' hacerlo otra ve', pero mi tiempo e' oro
Yo por nadie me ajoro
Te digo que ni lo intente', eh
La vida e' una y yo solo vivo el presente 
Me gusta cuando estás caliente 
Ahora me quieres pa' ti, mami, tú ere' exigente, y
Bellaqueando excelente , je
Pero se pone romántica de repente, y 
Del amor no soy creyente 
Cupido e' un huelebicho, ese cabrón siempre me miente
Y me hace pensar en cosas que no van a pasar
Ya sé cómo termina, ni lo vo'a comenzar
Que pase lo que pase, yo no lo vo'a forzar
Dime si te va' a quedar
Haciéndolo, tocándono', oh, oh, oh
Pa' esto sí, pero pa' aquello no, oh, oh
Haciéndolo, tocándono', oh, oh, oh
Pa' chingar sí, pero pa' serio no, oh
Lo siento, bebé 
No trates de enamorarme o no te hago coro 
Hace tiempo que de nadie yo no me enamoro 
Y estoy puesto pa' uste', pa' hacerlo otra ve', pero mi tiempo e' oro
Yo por nadie me ajoro
>>>Me Fui de Vacaciones Bad Bunny

El sol salió a janguear con las nube' y me regalaron un día cabrón
Como cuando me quedaba en Boquerón o en Manatí
Lo mejor nunca se sube, a menos que en la radio salga esta canción
Hoy vo'a darle paz a mi corazón, por eso me perdí
Me fui de vacacione' con muchas cerveza' y cancione'
Un shot por las buenas amistade' y por las bendicione'
Y si el día se pone feo, tú me lo haces bonito
Ya no pido más deseo', tengo todo lo que necesito
Y sorry con la gente que quiere saberlo todo
Si pongo el location, ya no e' un secret spot
Hoy vo'a pasarla bien y no pensar en na'
Y no pensar en na', y no pensar en na'
Porque a veces pienso tanto
Que me olvido de dar gracias cuando me levanto
A veces pienso tanto que me olvido de pensar en mí
Que me olvido hasta de dormir, ey
Así que no se asusten si desaparezco
Un rato bien lejo', yo me lo merezco
No me hablen del trabajo, no me hablen de escuela
Que ya subí el ancla y abrí las vela'
Puedo ver el paraíso llegando a Isabela
Un mango de Mayagüe', despué' pa' La Palguera
Puerto Rico se ve lindo hasta en Google Maps
Y hoy le quiero dar la vuelta con Sensei, con Gabs
Lo que traigo es vibra linda, no quiero frontear
Pa' la' babie' yo después saco un disco de trap
No me busque', que no me va' a encontrar
No me va' a encontrar, no, no
Me fui de vacacione' con muchas cerveza' y cancione'
Un shot por las buenas amistade' y por las bendicione' 
Y si el día se pone feo, tú me lo haces bonito
Ya no pido más deseo', tengo todo lo que necesito
Ey, ya no pido más deseo', tengo todo lo que necesito

Pa' que to' el mundo vea lo rica que tú está', que tú está'

Y еn la calle ando suelto, pero por ti mе quito
Si tú me lo pide', yo me porto bonito
Y subo un selfie pa' que vean lo rica que tú está', que tú está'

En la calle ando suelto, pero por ti me quito
Si tú me lo pide', yo me porto bonito

Si el novio no sirve, de una lo bota
Y wow, mami, dime dónde dejo el résume 
Sé que te dejaste hace un me' 
Y de una de pecho me zumbé
Si quiere' te hago un bebé o te traigo la plan B
Uff, mami, qué rica tú te ve'
Pa' los 2000 escuchaba RBD
Y ahora quiere perreo, to'a la noche en la pared
Mami, tú ere' élite , no te me limite' 
Déjame hacerte lo que amerite y te levite
Dale pa'l escondite , no te me arisque' 
Que aquí no va a poder llegar lo' satélite' 
Mami, sube algo, dame contenido
Ese culo súbelo má' seguido
Me paso jangueando, a ver si coincido, ey
Y por fin doy contigo
Mai, nuestra' bellaquera' nunca la' olvido
Ninguna como tú a mí me ha complacido
Tú cree' que a toda' siempre les digo lo mismo
Quiere chingar, pero no quiere na' fijo, ey
Pero en confianza me confiesa
Dice que nadie le interesa
Pero cuando sale, se pone traviesa 
Pa' que to' el mundo vea lo rica que tú está', que tú está', ey
Contigo tengo que apretar
Y en la calle ando suelto, pero por ti me quito
Si tú me lo pide', yo me porto bonito

No sé, entre tú y yo ya no hay conexión
Pa'l carajo el perdón, no hay reconciliación

Talk big, talk big tough, but he ain't runnin' up 
Oh my god, just shut the fuck up 
Steady my aim, bitch, I'm tryna focus 
I ain't hit my opus, I'm free throw throwin' 
'Til the day that I make it, I'm Deebo throwin' 
Got one-hundred mana, don't need mo' potions 
Just sit down and rappin', I make more than you make 
Got ten people wit' me, don't need more crewmates 
I know some rappers who want me dead today
I'm turnin' it up, man, I'm sorry, it's too late
I'm off three edibles, bitch, I am too baked
But I'm still smokin', I rolled up like two J' 
Dick in her mouth finna give her a toothache 
I'm on my Blackbeard, I'm makin' the room shake 
Hold on, why you just talkin', man? Do things
When you stay solid, it's normal a fеw change
I done seen peoplе switch up for some loose change
Turn up all year just to start makin' blue things 
Walk in the room and I'm feelin' the mood change
Keep it a fitted, you cap on a few things 
All black techwear, look like Bruce Wayne
Usopp Haki, I'm ready to shoot things 
Red eye on the choppa, no observation
Like Sanji, the kick on it hot as Cajun
In the black leg Mase', I got it skating
Scratchman, when he talk, it is not amazing
Scratchmen, big drum got 'em all breaking
How he say that he solid? He not fading
Wrist came with the rocks, but I'm not David
When I drive in the whip, I am not braking 
When I drive in the whip, I'm handbrake driftin'
White plug shoot the birds like Blake Griffin
That shit got me sick, y'all stay simpin' 
I slid to Boynton, brought a play wit' me 
Big scope on the Nerf, got a ray wit' it 
If my bro' brought the pack, I ain't stayin' wit' it 
I'm over my old foes, that finished 
Holy rounds finna drop you, the praise vicious 
K on Cloud and plays in tens 
I don't see how you got hits, it don't make no sense 
Push to start, fuck it, push your brain cells out just like a fart 
I done fucked yo' mama by the time you get paid for yo' art 
This troop coupé, dippin' to yo' block, I tell 'em, "Shoot you" 
My zo's up, in the dead of night, they wake at noon, too 
I don't keep no goons, I keep brothers, we in tune, too 
Ain't no cred' but mine, I held down before I knew you, bitch
Uh, uh, way that I see it, you stupid 
Way that I see it, you losin' 
Way that I see it, you droppin' a hit is just poopin', shit dookie 
I'm really shootin', I'm makin' a movie 
You singin' a lot and that shit do not move me 
You a bitch, groupie 
Red shooter, he look like Youpi 
Switch out with my demon, Yuji
Bet we testing his pockets, no Dukey
Bet he shake like Groovy Smoothie
Camera gon' wet up his block like jacuzzi 
My shooter flashin', we making a movie 
Cracking the seal, boy, I'm pourin' the goopy 
Smokin' on za, boy, you smoke on a loosey
I'm really back in this bitch, goin' stupid 
I'm really packing a fifth in my loose leaf 
Speak with my chest, I ain't finna talk loosely 
She wanna kick it, I gave her the Bruce Lee 
Bro' off the Perc' and he actin' real loopy
My circle small, I ain't fuckin' with goofies 
Damn, that pussy think that he knew me 
Hop in the booth and I start fuckin' puking 
You niggas hungry, but you didn't help me when I was down bad with a lot on my plate 
You chasin' bitches and I'm chasin' Benjamins, sorry, my nigga, we do not relate
Funny how they talkin' hot as the tropics, but they only talk when they not in my state 
Glock C-R-7, the stick got a kick to the shot and it shoot with a li'l bit of pace 
Know they hate me, the way that I brag ugly, bet they say that it's gross when I bag money 
If you talk, but it's not about racks, buddy, yo no me conoce like I'm Bad Bunny 
Did he say that he takin' this cash from me? Got me laughin' like, "Brodie, you mad funny" 
Bet I'm snappin' his neck like a crash dummy
Bet I'm snappin' his head like a bag bungee
Run up in the moshpit, he get fucked up 
Ran up in the pit, he get fucked up , fucked up)
Rollin' wit' my clique? You get fucked up 
Out of luck? You get fucked up 
I just pulled up, brought the Tonka 
Bitch, we in that truck, smokin' blunts 
I'm like, "Bitch, what's up?" 
Don't give a fuck, we turn this shit up 
SLehmo with the beat, boy

Saw the world in your eyes, now tell me what you see in me
Tried my best to keep it cool when I heard you cheated on me
Man you played me like a fool, the way you was creepin’ on me
I brought you over to mi casa
But you crossed me like Mufasa
Peelin’ my layers like I'm a banana
Blocked out the world, I'll build me a cabana
I hate you, I love you
You push me, I shove you
I cuffed you, now regret you
I left you, now forget you
Mmm, baby I miss you
Don’t wanna miss you, no
Me di la vuelta ahora por ti no puedo ya confiar
Como besabas lentamente entraste tu en mi
Never wanted to experience this pain 
Drinking henny, tryna keep my mind sane
Can’t focus  like I got a birdbrain
She been on my thoughts, flooded like she was my main 
Feelin’ like I’ve run outta energy 
You turned a friend into an enemy
Tried to get me back so desperately
These other girls, they be failin’ me 
See you with a guy, i feel jealousy
Only escape is this melody
T-Money from The 5, he a legacy

Mmm, baby I miss you
Don’t wanna miss you, no

Why did you cheat on me 
I believed in you
How I treated you 
How I took care of you
Why did you cheat on me 
I believed in you
How I treated you 
How I took care of you
Did me dirty, now I'm in my feelins
I'm down low, tryna touch the ceilins
Tryna keep it in, I'm bare concealin’
I'm frontin’, stuntin’, I'm freewheelin’
They say real men don't cry
But you can see the truth in my eyes
Tryna numb the pain with this money

Tan ilógico como extraerme de tu piel
Después de Dios, soy tu todo, mujer
¿Qué tal te está yendo con él?
Yo sé que al final
A mí no me olvidas tan siquiera un poco
Al final, baby, tú extrañas cómo yo te toco
Recuerda, de tu cuerpo sé yo, mami
Cada rincón por dentro y por fuera
Dile que volví por ti 
Yo soy ese tatuaje, mami, que no se te borra
Sin palomería', yo no bajo con cotorra
Dile al bobo ese que еn mí siempre e' quе tú piensa'
Que cuando él termina e' cuando tú apena' comienza'
Y ahí e', ahí e' cuando tú siente' la diferencia
Yo siempre te daba con consistencia
Dile que se retire, haga su diligencia
Porque volví por ti 
Pa' hacértelo bien rico como te gusta a ti
Ponte en cuatro y te la saco como lo hace Tatí'
Te montaste en la Jeepeta y no tenía' panty
So no te engañes
Que e' imposible que no me extrañe'
Lo nuestro e' de año', no hay forma de que se dañe
Con él ni suda', no hace falta ni que tú te bañe'

¿Cómo carajo ese palomo va a compararse conmigo?
Ni te conoce mientras yo soy tu delirio
Tengo la fecha escrita en el calendario
Si yo volví a Aventura, tú regresas a mi lado, baby
Que cuente las horas
Es su destino, tú y yo tenemo' historia
Para que él vea que el dinero no lo es todo
Te enamoré con mi lujuria, yo controlo
Tú sabes que ese tipo es temporal
Anda, arranca y dile
Tú despide de una vez a ese cabró— 
Porque volví por ti
Pa' hacértelo bien rico como te gusta a ti

Lo haces con él pero pensando en mí
Inconforme con ese infeliz
Hey, you end up with me
Yo sé que al final
A mí no me olvida' tan siquiera un poco
Al final, baby, tú te mojas cuando yo te toco
Recuerda, de tu cuerpo sé yo, mami

I haven't done a cartwheel since I was nine
I haven't seen my mother in a long, long time
I mean, look at me
Look at the length of my hair, and my face, the shape of my body
Do you really think I give a damn
What I do after years of just hearing them talking?
I say I live in Rosemead, really, I'm at the Ramada
It doesn't really matter, doesn't really, really matter
Call him up, "Come into my bedroom"
Ended up, we fuck on the hotel floor
It's not about havin' someone to love me anymorе
This is the experiеnce of bein' an American whore
Called up one drunk, called up another
Forensic Files wasn't on
Watching Teenage Diary of a Girl
Wondering what went wrong
I'm a princess, I'm divisive
Ask me why, why, why I'm like this
Maybe I'm just kinda like this
I don't know, maybe I'm just like this
I say I live in Rosemead, really, I'm at the Ramada
It doesn't really matter, doesn't really, really matter
Call him up, he comes over again
Yeah, I know I'm over my head but, oh
It's not about havin' someone to love me anymore
No, this is the experience of bein' an American whore
I mean look at my hair
Look at the length of it and the shape of my body
If I told you that I was raped
Do you really think that anybody would think
I didn't ask for it? I didn't ask for it
I won't testify, I already fucked up my story
On top of this , so many other things you can't believe
Did you know a singer can still be
Looking like a sidepiece at thirty-three?
Got a cop who turned on the backbeat
Puts the shower on while he calls me
Slips out the back door to talk to me
I'm invisible, look how you hold me
I'm invisible, I'm invisible
I'm a ghost now, look how you hold me now
It's not about havin' someone to love me anymore 
No, this is the experience of bein' an American whore
It's not about havin' someone to love me anymore
No, this is the experience of bein' an American whore
This is the experience of bein' an American whore

My body is a map of LA
I stand straight like an angel with a halo
Hangin' out the Hilton Hotel window
Screamin', "Hey, you, baby, let's go"
My chest, the Sierra Madre
My hips, every high and byway
That you trace with your fingertips like a Toyota
Run your hands over me like a Land Rover
All roads that lead to you as integral to me as arteries
That pump the blood that flows straight to the heart of me
I can't sleep at home tonight, send me a Hilton Hotel
Or a cross on the hill, I'm a lost little girl
Findin' my way to you, Arcadia
My body is a map of LA
And my heart is like paper, I hate you
I'm not from the land of the palms, so I know I can't stay here
I'm not native, but
My curves, San Gabriel all day
And my lips like the fire licks the bay
If you think that you know yourself, you can come over
Lay your hands on me like you're a Land Rover
All roads that lead to you as integral to me as arteries
That get the blood flowing straight to the heart of me
America, I need a miracle
I can't sleep at home tonight, send me a Hilton Hotel
Or a cross on the hill, I'm a lost little girl
Findin' my way to you, Arcadia
They built me up three-hundred feet tall just to tear me down
So I'm leavin' with nothing but laughter, and this town
Findin' my way to you
I'm leavin' them as I was, five-foot-eight, Western belt
Plus the hate that they gave
By the way, thanks for that, on the way, I'll pray for you
But you'll need a miracle, America

Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I've been waiting to meet you
Palm trees in the light, I can see, late at night
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you
Come to me, baby
Spotlight, bad baby, you've got a flair
For the violentest kind of love anywhere out there
Mon amour, sweet child of mine, you're divine
Didn't anyone ever tell you it's okay to shine?
Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I've been waiting to meet you
Palm trees in the light, I can see, late at night
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you
Come to me, baby
Don't be afraid of me
Walk in the way of my soft resurrection
Idol of roses, iconic soul
I know your name
Lead me to war with your brilliant direction
Roses, Bel Air, take me there
I've been waiting to meet you
Palm trees in the light, I can see, late at night
Darling, I'm waiting to greet you

I used to think that I could trust you
I was your woman
You were my knight and shining companion
Was his own greed
With your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big lies
I noticed you got hot in summer
You had no comfort
Your shirt was cotton
Your face was sunburned
You paced around like you'd been waiting
Your world was burning and I stood watching
As I looked on
The flames grew high
You watched me frown
With your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big lies
Is it me, was I wrong to have trusted you?
Did I see what I wanted, what wasn't true?
Was I wrong to go on like a little fool?
It's amazing what women in love will do
With your big eyes
And your big lies
With your big eyes
And your big lies

>>>Blue Jeans Lana Del Rey
<sos>
Blue jeans, white shirt
Walked into the room, you know you made my eyes burn
It was like James Dean for sure
You're so fresh to death and sick as ca-cancer
You were sorta punk rock, I grew up on hip hop
But you fit me better than my favorite sweater
And I know that love is mean  and love hurts 
But I still remember that day we met in December, oh, baby
I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember , say you'll remember
Oh, baby, ooh—I will love you till the end of time
Said you had to leave to start your life over
I was like, "No, please—stay here
We don't need no money, we could make it all work"
But he headed out on Sunday, said he'd come home Monday
I stayed up waiting, anticipating, and pacing
But he was chasing  paper 
Caught up in the game, that was the last I heard
I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember , say you'll remember
Oh, baby, ooh—I will love you till the end of time
You went out every night, and baby, that's alright
I told you that no matter what you did, I'd be by your side
'Cause I'ma ride or die, whether you fail or fly
Well, shit, at least you tried
But when you walked out that door, a piece of me died
Told you I wanted more; that's not what I had in mind
I just want it like before, we were dancing all night
Then they took you away, stole you out of my life
You just need to remember
I will love you 'til the end of time
I would wait a million years
Promise you'll remember that you're mine
Baby, can you see through the tears?
Love you more than those bitches before
Say you'll remember , say you'll remember
Oh, baby, ooh—I will love you till the end of time

>>>Blue Velvet Lana Del Rey
<sos>
She wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet was the night
Softer than satin was the light
She wore blue velvet
Bluer than velvet were her eyes
Warmer than May, her tender sighs
Ours a love I held tightly
Feeling the rapture grow
Like a flame burning brightly
But when she left, gone was the glow of
But in my heart there'll always be
Precious and warm a memory
And I still can see blue velvet through my tears
<eos>
>>>Born to Die Lana Del Rey
<sos>
Feet don't fail me now
Take me to the finish line
Oh, my heart, it breaks every step that I take
But I'm hoping at the gates, they'll tell me that you're mine
Walking through the city streets, is it by mistake or design?
I feel so alone on a Friday night
Can you make it feel like home, if I tell you you're mine?
It's like I told you, honey 
Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laugh—let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane 
Choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I—we were born to die
Lost, but now I am found
I can see that once I was blind
I was so confused as a little child
Tried to take what I could get, scared that I couldn't find
All the answers I need 
Don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laugh—let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane 
Choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I—we were born to die 
We were born to die 
We were born to die
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane
So don't make me sad, don't make me cry
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough
I don't know why
Keep making me laugh—let's go get high
The road is long, we carry on
Try to have fun in the meantime
Come and take a walk on the wild side
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain
You like your girls insane 
So choose your last words, this is the last time
'Cause you and I—we were born to die
We were born to die
>>>Burning Desire Lana Del Rey

Every Saturday night, I get dressed up to ride for you, baby
Cruising down the street on Hollywood and Vine for you, baby
I drive fast, wind in my hair
I push it to the limits 'cause I just don't care
You ask me where I've been; I been everywhere
But I don't want to be nowhere but here
I've got a burning desire for you, baby
I drive fast, wind in my hair
I push it to the limits 'cause I just don't care 
I've got a burning desire for you, baby
Every Saturday night I seem to come alive for you, baby
Santa Monica, I'm racing in the lights for you, baby
I drive fast, radio blares
Have to touch myself to pretend you're there
Your hands were on my hips, your name was on my lips
Over, over again like my only prayer
I've got a burning desire for you, baby
I drive fast, wind in my hair
I push it to the limits 'cause I just don't care 
I've got a burning desire for you, baby
I'm driving fast, flash!

>>>Change Lana Del Rey
<sos>
There's somethin' in the wind, I can feel it blowin' in
It's comin' in softly on the wings of a bomb
There's somethin' in the wind, I can feel it blowin' in
It's comin' in hotly and it's coming in strong
Lately, I've been thinkin' it's just someone else's job to care
Who am I to sympathize when no one gave a damn?
I've been thinkin' it's just someone else's job to care
Who am I to wanna try? But
Change is a powerful thing, people are powerful beings
Tryin' to find the power in me to be faithful
Change is a powerful thing, I feel it comin' in me
Maybe by the time summer's done
I'll be able to be honest, capable
Of holdin' you in my arms without lettin' you fall
When I don't feel beautiful or stable
Maybe it's enough to just be where we are, because
Every time that we run, we don't know what it's from
Now we finally slow down, we feel close to it
There's a change gonna come, I don't know where or when
But whenever it does, we'll be here for it
There's somethin' in the wind, I can feel it blowin' in
It's comin' in softly on the wings of a song
There's somethin' in the water, I can taste it turnin' sour
It's bitter, I'm coughin', but now it's in my blood
Lately, I've been thinkin' it's just someone else's job to care
Who am I to sympathize when no one gave a damn?
I've been thinkin' it's just someone else's job to care
'Cause who am I to wanna try? But
Change is a powerful thing, people are powerful beings

I'm on the run with you, my sweet love
There's nothing wrong contemplating God
Under the chemtrails over the country club
We're in our jewels in the swimming pool
Me and my sister just playin' it cool
Under the chemtrails over the country club
Take out your turquoise and all of your jewels
Go to the market, the kids' swimming pools
Baby, what's your sign?
My moon's in Leo, my Cancer is sun
You won't play, you're no fun
Well, I don't care what they think
Drag racing my little red sports car
I'm not unhinged or unhappy, I'm just wild

There's nothing wrong contemplating God

We're in our jewels in the swimming pool
Me and my sister just playin' it cool
Under the chemtrails over the country club
Meet you for coffee at the elementary schools
We laugh about nothing as the summer gets cool
It's beautiful how this deep normality settles down over me
I'm not bored or unhappy, I'm still so strange and wild
I'm in the wind, I'm in the water
Nobody's son, nobody's daughter
Watching the chemtrails over the country club
Suburbia, The Brentwood Market
What to do next? Baby, what of it?
White picket chemtrails over the country club
My love, my love
Washing my hair, doing the laundry
Late night TV, I want you only
Like when we were kids under chemtrails and country clubs
It's never too late, baby, so don't give up
Under the chemtrails over the country club, yeah 
Under the chemtrails, over the country club, yeah

Cinnamon in my teeth
From your kiss, you're touching me
All the pills that you take
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me at arm's length don't work
You try to push me out, but I just find my way back in
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me out, I win
There's things I wanna say to you, but I'll just let you live
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
There's things I wanna talk about, but better not to give
But if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah
Hold me, love me, touch me, honey
Be the first who ever did
Kerosene in my hands
You make me mad, on fire again
All the pills that you take
Violet, blue, green, red to keep me at arm's length don't work
There's things I wanna say to you, but I'll just let you live
Like if you hold me without hurting me
You'll be the first who ever did

>>>Coachella – Woodstock in My Mind Lana Del Rey
<sos>
I was at Coachella leanin' on your shoulder
Watchin' your husband swing in time
I guess I was in it 'cause, baby, for a minute
It was Woodstock in my mind
In the next mornin' they put out the warnin'
Tensions were rising over country lines
I turned off the music, tried to sit and use it
All of the love that I saw that night
'Cause what about all these children
And what about all their parents?
And what about all their crowns they wear
In hair so long like mine?
And what about all their wishes wrapped up like garland roses
Round their little heads?
I said a prayer for a third time
I'd trade it all for a stairway to heaven 
I'd take my time for the climb up to the top of it 
I'd trade the fame and the fortune and the legend 
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask Him one question
I was at Coachella leaning on your shoulder
Watchin' your husband swing and shine
I'd say he was hella cool to win them over
Critics can be so mean sometimes
He was on his knees and I thought he was breakin' 'em down
With his words and his voice divine
Doesn't take a genius to know what you've got going
And to not wanna lose it 'cause they lost their minds
What about all these children and all their children's children?
And why am I even wonderin' that today?
Maybe my contribution could be as small as hoping
That words could turn to birds and birds would send my thoughts your way
I'd trade it all for a stairway to heaven 
I'd take my time for the climb up to the top of it 
I'd trade the fame and the fortune and the legend 
I'd give it all away if you give me just one day to ask Him one question
A stairway, stairway to heaven
Got a million things I wanna say
Like, what's it all for? Will it be okay?
Million things I wanna say
Like, what's it all for?
Stairway, stairway to heaven

My pussy tastes like Pepsi cola
My eyes are wide like cherry pies
I gots a taste for men who are older
It's always been so it's no surprise
Harvey's in the sky with diamonds and he's making me crazy
All he wants to do is party with his pretty baby
Come on, baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side
Come on, come on
Come on, come on, come on, baby
I fall asleep in an American flag
I wear my diamonds on Skid Row
I pledge allegiance to my dad
For teaching me everything he knows
Harvey's in the sky with diamonds and he's making me crazy
All he wants to do is party with his pretty baby
Come on, baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side
Drugs, suck it up, like vanilla icys
Don't treat me rough, treat me really niceys
Decorate my neck, diamantes ices
Why, come on, come on
Come on, baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
I know your wife and she wouldn't mind
We made it out to the other side
Come on, baby, let's ride
We can escape to the great sunshine
We made it out to the other side
Come on, come on, come on, baby

Did you know that there's a tunnel under Ocean Boulevard?
Mosaic ceilings, painted tiles on the wall
I can't help but feel somewhat like my body marred my soul
Handmade beauty sealed up by two man-made walls
When's it gonna be my turn?
Open me up, tell me you like it
Fuck me to death, love me until I love myself
There's a tunnel under Ocean Boulevard
Therе's a tunnel under Ocean Boulеvard
There's a girl who sings "Hotel California"
Not because she loves the notes or sounds that sound like Florida
It's because she's in a world, preserved, only a few have found the door
It's like Camarillo, only silver mirrors, running down the corridor
When's it gonna be my turn?
Open me up, tell me you like me
Fuck me to death, love me until I love myself
There's a tunnel under Ocean Boulevard
Harry Nilsson has a song, his voice breaks at 2:05
Something about the way he says "Don't forget me" makes me feel like
I just wish I had a friend like him, someone to give me five
Lennon in my back, whisperin' in my ear
"Come on, baby, you can thrive"
When's it gonna be my turn?
Open me up, tell me you like it
Fuck me to death, love me until I love myself
There's a tunnel under Ocean Boulevard

Summertime, and the livin's easy
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras MG
All the people in the dance will agree
That we're well-qualified to represent the L.B.C.
Me, me and Louie, we gonna run to the party
And dance to the rhythm, it gets harder
Me and my girl, we got this relationship
I love her so bad, but she treats me like shit
On lockdown, like a penitentiary
She spreads her lovin' all over
And when she gets home, there's none left for me
Summertime, and the livin's easy
Bradley's on the microphone with Ras MG
All the people in the dance will agree

Oh, take this veil from off my eyes
My burning sun will, some day, rise
So, what am I gonna be doin' for a while?
Said, I'm gonna play with myself
Show them how we come off the shelf

Evil, ornery, scandalous and evil, most definitely
The tension, it's getting hotter

Baby, you understand me now
If sometimes you see that I'm mad
Don't you know no one alive can always be an angel?
When everything goes wrong, you see some bad
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
You know, sometimes, baby, I'm so carefree
With a joy that's hard to hide
And then, sometimes, again, it seems that all I have is worry
And then you're bound to see my other side
But I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
If I seem edgy, I want you to know
I never meant to take it out on you
Life has its problems and I get more than my share
But that's one thing I never mean to do 'cause I love you
Oh, baby, I'm just human
Don't you know I have faults like anyone?
Sometimes, I find myself alone regretting some little foolish thing
Some simple thing that I've done
'Cause I'm just a soul whose intentions are good
Oh, Lord, please don't let me be misunderstood
I try so hard, don't let me be misunderstood
I try so hard, don't let me be misunderstood

I like to see everything in neon
Drink  lime green, stay up 'til dawn
Maybe  the way that I'm living is killing me
I like to light up the stage with a song
Do shit to keep me turned on
But  one day I woke up like
"Maybe  I'll do it differently"
So I moved to California‚ but it's just a state of mind
It  turns out everywhere you go‚ you take yourself‚ that's not a lie
Wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
It's killing me slowly
Dream a little dream of me
Make  me into something sweet
Turn the radio on, dancing to a pop song
Fuck it, I love you
Fuck it‚ I love you
Fuck it, I love you
I used to shoot up my veins in neon
And shit's even brighter; you're gone
So many things I would say to you
You moved to California, but it's just a state of mind
And you know everyone adores you
You can't feel it and you're tired
Baby‚ wish that you would hold me or just say that you were mine
But it's killing me slowly
Dream a little dream of me
Turn this into something sweet
Turn the radio on, dancing to a pop song
Fuck it, I love you
It turns out California's more than just a state of mind
I met you on the boulevard, braids in my hair, you blew my mind
And if I wasn't so fucked up, I think I'd fuck you all the time
It's killing me slowly
Fuck it, I love you 
Fuck it, I love you

I'm crossing the threshold
From the ordinary world
To the reveal of my heart
That will for certain
Take the dead out of the sea
And the darkness from the arts
This is my commitment
I'm doin' it for all of us
Who never got the chance
For… and for… 
And all my birds of paradise 
Who never got to fly at night 
'Cause they were caught up in the dance
Sometimes it feels like I've got a war in my mind
I want to get off, but I keep ridin' the ride
I never really noticed that I had to decide
To play someone's game or live my own life
And now I do
Out of the black 
Into the blue 
Gone is the burden
Of the Crowley way of being
That comes from energies combined
Like my part was I
And you, as we found out
Were not in your right mind
There's no more chasing rainbows
And hoping for an end to them
Their arches are illusions
Solid at first glance
But then you try to touch them 
There's nothing to hold on to 
The colors used to lure you in 
And put you in a trance 
Sometimes it feels like I've got a war in my mind
I want to get off, but I keep ridin' the ride
I never really noticed that I had to decide
To play someone's game or live my own life
And now I do
Out of the black 
Into the blue 
Out of the black

Glowing finish line, made it in record time
Hey, baby, we made it
My head's faded, headlights dilated
Spinnin', spinnin' and I can't sit still
Spinnin', spinnin' and we can't sit still
Baptized in blue skies
Roll the window down, reach out, feel around for new life
Damn, you and those green eyes
We can never stop movin', we see nothin' but the green lights
Spinnin', spinnin' and we can't sit still
God save, God save our young blood
God save, God save our young love
Hot pavement, hot pavement, hot wheels in the sun
God save our young blood
God save, God save our young blood
God save, God save our young love
Warm waves, warm waves, on the coast where we love
God save our young blood
Climbed up the tree of life, kicked out of paradise
Living good, living evil is the toss of the dice
Couple of wild eyes, cup full of high life
She's an angel and a devil of her own device
She's got me spinnin' 
Spinnin' and I can't sit still 
Oh, spinnin', spinnin' and we can't sit still

Warm waves, warm waves, on the coast where we love
God save our young blood
God save the ocean, God save the breeze
Save the words from my lips, save the birds, save the bees
Baby save me one last sip while you strip on the beach
I'll save you in the waves if you swim too deep
God save, God save our young blood
God save our young love
God save, God save our young blood

>>>Gods & Monsters Lana Del Rey

In the land of gods and monsters
I was an angel living in the garden of evil
Screwed up, scared, doing anything that I needed
Shining like a fiery beacon
You got that medicine I need
Fame, liquor, love, give it to me slowly
Put your hands on my waist, do it softly
Me and God, we don't get along, so now I sing
No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees, sprees and I'm singing
"Fuck yeah, give it to me, this is﻿ Heaven, what I truly want"
It's innocence lost, innocence lost
In the land of gods and monsters
I was an angel looking to get fucked hard
Like a groupie incognito, posing as a real singer
You got that medicine I need
Dope, shoot it up, straight to the heart, please
I don't really wanna know what's good for me
God's dead, I said, "Baby, that's alright with me"
No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees, sprees and I'm singing
"Fuck yeah, give it to me, this is﻿ Heaven, what I truly want"
It's innocence lost, innocence lost
When you talk, it's like a movie and you're makin' me crazy
'Cause life imitates art
If I get a little prettier, can I be your baby?
You tell me life isn't that hard
No one's gonna take my soul away
I'm living like Jim Morrison
Headed towards a fucked up holiday
Motel sprees, sprees and I'm singing
"Fuck yeah, give it to me, this is﻿ Heaven, what I truly want"
It's innocence lost, innocence lost

>>>Goodbye Kiss Lana Del Rey

Doomed from the start
We met with a goodbye kiss, I broke my wrist
It all kicked off, I had no choice
You said that you didn't mind 'cause love's hard to find
Maybe the days we had are gone, living in silence for too long
Open your eyes and what do you see?
No more laughs, no more photographs
Turning slowly, looking back, see
No words, can save this, you're broken and I'm pissed
Run along like I'm supposed to, be the man I ought to
Rock and roll sent us insane
I hope someday that we will meet again
Giving it everyone, now that's all done
Maybe the days we had are gone, living in silence for too long
Open your eyes and what  you see?
ThNo more laughs, no more photographs
Turning slowly, looking back, see
No words can save us, you're broken and I'm pissed
Run along like I'm supposed to, be the man I ought to
Rock and roll sent us insane
I hope someday that we will meet again
You go your way and I'll go my way
No words can save us, this lifestyle made us
Run along like I'm supposed to, be the man I ought to
Rock and roll sent us insane
I hope someday that we will meet again

I'm gonna take mine with you with me
Ah, "mine," say it again
"Mine of you with me," thank you, one more time
I'm gonna take mine of you with me
Like "Rocky Mountain High," the way John Denver sings
So you say there's a chance for us
Should I do a dance for once?
You're a family man, but
Do you think about Heaven?
Oh-oh, do you think about me?
My pastor told me when you leave, all you take
Oh-oh, is your memory
And I'm gonna take minе of you with me
I'm gonna take mine of you with mе
So many mountains too high to climb
So many rivers so long, but I'm
Doin' the hard stuff, I'm doin' my time
I'm doin' it for us, for our family line
Do you think about Heaven?
Oh-oh, do you think about me?
My pastor told me 
When you leave, all you take 
Oh-oh, is your memories
And I wanna take mine of you with me
I'm gonna take mine of you with me
Yeah, I'm gonna take mine of you with me
Like "Rocky Mountain High," the way John Denver sings

I'm gonna take that too with me
It's a beautiful life 
Remember that too for me

You're in the bar playin' guitar
I'm trying not to let the crowd next to me
It's so hard sometimes with a star
When you have to share him with everybody
You're in the club livin' it up
I'm trying not to let the crowd notice me
It's so sweet swingin' to the beat
When I know that you're doin' it all for me
And every time you look up
I know what you're thinkin' of
Time after time, writing my lines
Havin' my baby there next to me
It's so sweet pourin' you a drink
And pretendin' that nothin' means anything
This is my life, you by my side
Key lime and perfume and festivals
Taking our dreams, turning them to things
It's like magic, babe, isn't life wonderful?
And every time we hook up
I know what you're thinkin' of
Front row, every show like a hype man
Sing along, word for word, watchin' my bae
Side stage, fans screamin' causin' migraines
Yamborghini-high, but she ain't on my grade
God dang, got a nigga actin' irate
My babe, my babe, stay on my brain
My babe, made me sing to a fire escape
City girl, but she grew up in the tri-state
She ain't got no time for no groupie love
We don't pay no minds to the girl with her boobs out
Girl it's you and I, so who do we trust?
You and I 'til the day we die

Pushing past the limit, trippin' on hallucinogenics
My cigarette burnt my finger 'cause I forgot I lit it
Rippin' with my sinners 'cause fuck it, man, I ain't no beginner
And then I crawled back to the life that I said I wouldn't live in
'Cause I just couldn't open up, I'm always shiftin'
Go find yourself a man who's strong and tall and Christian
Pushing past the limit, trippin' on hallucinogenics
My cigarette burnt my finger 'cause I forgot I lit it
Drunken in Seattle, two more Xans and without a paddle
I don't remember your face or your hair or your name or your smile
'Cause I just couldn't open up, I'm always shiftin'
Go find yourself a man who's strong and tall and Christian
Pushing past the limit, trippin' on hallucinogenics
And then I crawled back to thе life that I said I wouldn't live in
'Cause I carriеd on like the wayward son
And now through and through, I've come undone
And now I am just but the wayward man
What with my bloodshot eyes and my shaky hands
'Cause I carried on like the wayward son
And now through and through, I've come undone
And now I am just but the wayward man
What with my bloodshot eyes and my shaky hands
Pushing past the limit, trippin' on hallucinogenics
My cigarette burnt my finger 'cause I forgot I lit it

If this is all that's real
All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high
All I wanna do is get by by the beach
Get by, baby, baby, bye-bye
The truth is I never bought into your bullshit
When you would pay tribute to me 'cause I know that
All I wanted to do was get high by the beach
Get high, baby, baby, bye-bye
Boy, look at you lookin' at me
I know you don't understand
You could be a bad motherfucker
But that don't make you a man
Now you're just another one of my problems
Because you got out of hand
We're sinkin' into the sand
All I wanna do is get high by the beach
Get high by the beach, get high

That it's not fashionable to love me
But you don't go
'Cause, truly, there's nobody for you but me
We could cruise to the blues
Wilshire Boulevard, if we choose
Or whatever you wanna do
We make the rules
Say you want me, too
The history of violence that surrounds you
But I'm not scared
There's nothing to lose now that I've found you
And we could cruise to the news
Pico Boulevard in your used
Little bullet car, if we choose
Say you want me, too
There are violets in your eyes
There are guns that blaze around you
There are roses in between my thighs
Fire that surrounds you
It's no wonder every man in town
Had neither fought nor found you
Everything you do is elusive, too
Even your honey dew
Dreaming away your life
Dreaming away your life, mmm
Dreaming away your life
Dreaming away your life, mmm

I was reading Slim Aarons and I got to thinking that I thought
Maybe I'd get less stressed if I was tested less like
All of these debutantes
Smiling for miles in pink dresses and high heels on white yachts
But I'm not, baby, I'm not
No, I'm not, that, I'm not
I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown
Writing in blood on my walls
'Cause the ink in my pen don't work in my notepad
Don't ask if I'm happy, you know that I'm not
But at best, I can say I'm not sad
'Cause hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
I had 15-year dances
Church basement romances, yeah, I've cried
Spilling my guts with the Bowery Bums
Is the only love I've ever known
Except for the stage, which I also call home, when I'm not
Servin' up God in a burnt coffee pot for the triad
Hello, it's the most famous woman you know on the iPad
Calling from beyond the grave, I just wanna say, "Hi, Dad"
I've been tearing up town in my fucking white gown
Like a goddamn near sociopath
Shaking my ass is the only thing that's
Got this black narcissist off my back
She couldn't care less, and I never cared more
So there's no more to say about that
Except hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman with my past
There's a new revolution, a loud evolution that I saw
Born of confusion and quiet collusion of which mostly I've known
A modern day woman with a weak constitution, 'cause I've got
Monsters still under my bed that I could never fight off
A gatekeeper carelessly dropping the keys on my nights off
I've been tearing around in my fucking nightgown
Writing in blood on your walls
'Cause the ink in my pen don't look good in my pad
They write that I'm happy, they know that I'm not
But at best, you can see I'm not sad
But hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have
Hope is a dangerous thing for a woman like me to have

Took a trip to San Francisco

Didn't  work, so I left for Fresno
It was quite a scenic drive
Pulled over to watch the children in the park
We  used to only worry for them after dark
I’m  still looking for my own version of America
One without the gun, where the flag can freely fly
No  bombs in the sky, only fireworks when you and I collide
It's just a dream I had in mind
It’s just a dream I had in mind
I  flew back to New York City
Missed that Hudson River line
Took a train up to Lake Placid
That's another place and time, where

>>>Mariners Apartment Complex Lana Del Rey

You took my sadness out of context
At the Mariners Apartment Complex
I ain't no candle in the wind
I'm the board, the lightning, the thunder
Kind of girl who's gonna make you wonder
Who you are and who you've been
And who I've been is with you on these beaches
Your Venice bitch, your die-hard, your weakness
Maybe I could save you from your sins
So kiss the sky and whisper to Jesus
My, my, my, you found this, you need this
Take a deep breath, baby, let me in
You lose your way, just take my hand
You're lost at sea, then I'll command your boat to me again
Don't look too far, right where you are, that's where I am
They mistook my kindness for weakness
I fucked up, I know that, but Jesus
Can't a girl just do the best she can?
Catch a wave and take in the sweetness
Think about it, the darkness, the deepness
All the things that make me who I am
And who I am is a big-time believer
That people can change, but you don't have to leave her
When everyone's talking, you can make a stand
'Cause even in the dark, I feel your resistance
You can see my heart burning in the distance
Baby, baby, baby, I'm your man, yeah
You lose your way, just take my hand
You're lost at sea, then I'll command your boat to me again
Don't look too far, right where you are, that's where I am
Catch a wave and take in the sweetness
Take in the sweetness
You want this, you need this
Are you ready for it?
Are you ready for it?

>>>National Anthem Lana Del Rey

Money is the anthem of success
So before we go out, what's your address?
I'm your national anthem
God, you're so handsome
Take me to the Hamptons, Bugatti Veyron
He loves to romance 'em
Holdin' me for ransom, upper echelon
He says to be cool, but I don't know how yet
Wind in my hair, hand on the back of my neck
I said, "Can we party later on?" He said, "Yes" 
Tell me I'm your national anthem
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem
Money is the reason we exist
Everybody knows it, it's a fact
I sing the national anthem while I am standin' over your body
Hold you like a python
And you can't keep your hands off me or your pants on
See what you've done to me, King of Chevron?
He said to be cool, but I'm already coolest
I said to get real, don't you know who you're dealing with?
Um, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds?
Tell me I'm your national anthem
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem
It's a love story for the new age
For the sixth page
We're on a quick, sick rampage
Wining and dining, drinking and driving
Excessive buying, overdose and dying
On our drugs and our love and our dreams and our rage
Blurring the lines between real and the fake
Dark and lonely, I need somebody to hold me
He will do very well, I can tell, I can tell
Keep me safe in his belltower hotel
Money is the anthem of success
So put on mascara and your party dress
I'm your national anthem
Boy, put your hands up
Give me a standing ovation
Boy, you have landed
Babe, in the land of
Sweetness and danger, Queen of Saigon
Tell me I'm your national anthem
Red, white, blue is in the sky
Summer's in the air and, baby, heaven's in your eyes
I'm your national anthem
Money is the anthem
God, you're so handsome
Money is the anthem of success
Money is the anthem

My old man is a bad man
But I can't deny the way he holds my hand
And he grabs me, he has me by my heart
He doesn't mind I have a Las Vegas past
He doesn't mind I have a L.A. crass way about me
He loves me with every beat of his cocaine heart
Swimming pool, glimmering darling
White bikini off with my red nail polish
Watch me in the swimming pool
You sittin', sippin' on your Black Cristal
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Be a good baby, do what I want
Light of my life, fire of my loins
Gimme them gold coins
And I'm off to the races
Cases of Bacardi chasers
Chasing me all over town
'Cause he knows I'm wasted
Facing time again at Rikers Island
And I won't get out
Because I'm crazy, baby
I need you to come here and save me
I'm your little scarlet, starlet
Singing in the garden
Kiss me on my open mouth
My old man is a tough man
But he got a soul as sweet as blood red jam
And he shows me, he knows me, every inch of my tar black soul
He doesn't mind I have a flat, broke-down life
In fact, he says he thinks it's what he might like about me
Admires me, the way I roll like a rollin' stone
Likes to watch me in the glass room, bathroom
Chateau Marmont, slippin' on my red dress, puttin' on my makeup
Glass room, perfume, cognac, lilac fumes
Says it feels like heaven to him
Light of his life, fire of his loins
Keep me forever, tell me you own me

Leather on my waist is tight and I am falling down

Love you, but I'm going down
God, I'm so crazy, baby
I'm sorry that I'm misbehaving
I'm your little harlot, starlet
Queen of Coney Island
Raising hell all over town
My old man is a thief
And I'm gonna stay and pray with him 'til the end
But I trust in the decision of the Lord
To watch over us
Take him when He may, if He may
I'm not afraid to say that I'd die without him
Who else is gonna put up with me this way?
I need you, I breathe you, I'd never leave you
They would rue the day I was alone without you
You're lying with your gold chain on
Cigar hanging from your lips
I said, "Hon', you never looked so beautiful
As you do now, my man"

Love will always be a lesson, let's get out of its way 
'Cause I know , all I know , all I know 
I'm a prisoner to my addiction

I'm a prisoner to my decisions

Been trying hard not to get into trouble, but I
I've got a war in my mind
So, I just ride, just ride

That's the way my father made his life and art
Drink all day and we talk 'til dark
That's the way the road dogs do it, light 'til dark
Don't leave me now 
Don't say goodbye

One night, a few moons ago
I saw flecks of what could've been lights
But it might just have been you
Passing by unbeknownst to me
Life is emotionally abusive
And time can't stop me quite like you did
And my flight was awful, thanks for asking
I'm unglued, thanks to you
And it's like snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
But it's comin' down
No sound, it's all around
Like snow on the beach
This scene feels like what I once saw on a screen
I searched "aurora borealis green"
I've never seen someone lit from within
Blurring out my periphery
My smile is like I won a contest
And to hide that would be so dishonest
And it's fine to fake it 'til you make it
'Til you do, 'til it's true
Now it's like snow at the beach
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream
Stars by the pocketful
But it's comin' down
No sound, it's all around
Like snow on the beach
I  can't  speak, afraid to jinx it
I  don't  even dare to wish it
But your eyes are flying saucers from another planet
Now I'm all for you like Janet
Can this be a real thing? Can it?
Are we falling like snow at the beach? 
Weird, but fuckin' beautiful
Flying in a dream 
Stars by the pocketful
You wanting me 
But it's comin' down

Only thing I ever gave up's using no more excuses
Excuse me if my head is too big for this building
And pardon me if I'm a cocky prick, but you cocks are slick
Poppin' shit on how you flipped your life around, crock of shit

Wasn’t ‘cause he had buzzards
Circlin' around his head, waitin' for him to drop dead, was it?

From a place that was dark as I was in just to get to this place
Now let these words be like a switchblade to a hater’s ribcage!
And let it be known that from this day forward, I wanna just say
Thanks, ‘cause your hate is what gave me the strength
So let them Bics raise, ‘cause I came with 5'9", but I feel like I’m 6'8"
This one's for you and me
Livin' out our dreams
We are right where we should be
With my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters
By the time you hear this, I’ll prolly already be outtie
I advance like goin' from totin' iron to goin' and buyin’
Four or five of the homies the Iron Man Audi
My daddy told me: "Slow down, boy, you're goin' to blow it!"
And I ain't gotta stop the beat a minute to tell Shady I love him
The same way that he did Dr. Dre on The Chronic
Tell him how real he is, or how high I am
Or how I would kill for him, for him to know it
I cried plenty tears, my daddy got a bad back
So it's only right that I write 'til he can march right
Into that post office and tell 'em to hang it up
Now his career's LeBron's Jersey in twenty years
I stop when I'm at the very top
You shitted on me on your way up, it's 'bout to be a scary drop
‘Cause what goes up must come down
You goin' down on somethin' you don't wanna see, like a hairy box
Every hour, happy hour now, life is wacky now
Used to have to eat the cat to get the pussy
Now I'm just the cat's meow, oww, outclass the count
Always down for the catchweight like Pacquiao
I remember when T-Pain ain't wanna work with me
My car starts itself, parks itself, and auto-tunes
‘Cause now I'm in the Aston; I went from havin'
My city locked up to gettin' treated like Kwame Kilpatrick
And now I'm fantastic, compare it to a weed high
And y'all niggas that's gossipin' like bitches
On the radio and TV, see me, we fly
Y'all buggin' out like Wendy Williams starin' at a beehive
And how real is that? I remember signin' my first deal
Now I'm the second best, I can deal with that
Now Bruno can show his ass, without the MTV awards gag
You and I know what it's like
To be kicked down, forced to fight
But tonight, we're all right
So hold up your lights
Let it shine, 'cause—
This one's for you and me
Livin' out our dreams
We are right where we should be
With my arms out wide, I open my eyes
And now all I wanna see
Is a sky full of lighters
A sky full of lighters

Standing at this liquor store
Whiskey coming through my pores
Feeling like I run this whole block
Lotto tickets, cheap beer

Uh, with everything happening today
You don't know whether you're coming or going, but
You think that ya on your way
Life lined up on the mirror, don't blow it
Woah, look at me when I'm talking to you
You looking at me but I'm looking through you
I see the blood in your eyes
I see the love in disguise
I see the pain hidden in your pride
I see you're not satisfied
And I don't see nobody else
I see myself, I'm looking at the
Mirror on the wall 
Here we are again 
Through my rise and fall 
You've been my only friend 
You told me that they can
Understand the man I am
So why are we here
Talking to each other again?
Uh, I see the truth in your lies
I see nobody by your side
But I'm with you when you're all alone
And you correct me when I'm looking wrong
I see the guilt beneath the shame
I see your soul through your window pane
I see the scars that remain
I see Wayne, I'm lookin' at the
Mirror on the wall
Here we are again 
Through my rise and fall 
You've been my only friend 
You told me that they can
Understand the man I am 
So why are we here 
Talking to each other again? 
Looking at me now I can see my past
Damn, I look just like my fucking dad
Light it up, that's smoke and mirrors
I even look good in a broken mirror
I see my mama smile, that's a blessing
I see the change, I see the message
And no message could've been any clearer
So I'm starting with the man in the
Mirror on the wall 
Here we are again
Through my rise and fall 
You've been my only friend 
You told me that they can
Understand the man I am
So why are we
Talking to each other again? 
Mirror on the wall 
Here we are again 
Through my rise and fall
You've been my only friend 
You told me that they can 
Understand the man I am 
So why are we here
Talking to each other again?

Hey B.P, looks like I did take 'em to Mars this time
So why are we
Talking to each other again?

You know, you look even better than the way you did the night before
And the moment that you kiss my lips, you know, I start to feel wonderful
There's sex in your chemicals, oh
You're the best way I know to escape the extraordinary
This world ain't for you and I know for damn sure this world ain't for me
Lift off and say goodbye
Just let your fire set me free
Take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time
I was with you last night but it feels like it's been so long
And everybody that's around, they notice that I'm not myself when you're gone
It's good to see you again
Good to see you again
On top of the world 
Is where I stand when you're back in my life
Life's not so bad when you're way up this high
Take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time
Your love, it makes me come alive
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time
Don't look down, no, don't never look back
We are not afraid to die young and live fast
Give me good times, give me love, give me laughs
Let's take a ride to the sky before the night is gone
Take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time
Your love, it makes me come alive
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time

Beautiful girls all over the world
I could be chasin', but my time would be wasted
They got nothin' on you, baby
Nothin' on you, baby
They might say "Hi", and I might say "Hey"
But you shouldn't worry about what they say
'Cause they got nothin' on you, baby
 Nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you, ha!
I know you feel where I'm comin' from 
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done 
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun 
On the carousel, so around I spun 
With no directions, just tryna get some 
Tryna chase skirts, livin' in the summer sun 
And so I lost more than I had ever won 
And honestly, I ended up with none 
There's so much nonsense, it's on my conscience
I'm thinkin' maybe I should get it out
And I don't wanna sound redundant, but I was wonderin'
If there was somethin' that you wanna know 
But never mind that, we should let it go 
'Cause we don't wanna be a TV episode 
And all the bad thoughts, just let 'em go
Beautiful girls all over the world
I could be chasin', but my time would be wasted
They got nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
Nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
They might say "Hi" , and I might say "Hey" 
But you shouldn't worry  about what they say 
'Cause they got nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
Nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you, ha!
Hands down, there will never be another one 
I been around and I never seen another one 
Because your style, they ain't really got nothin' on 
And you wild when you ain't got nothin' on 
Baby, you the whole package, plus you pay your taxes 
And you keep it real while them others stay plastic 
You're my Wonder Woman, call me Mr. Fantastic 
Stop, now think about it
I've been to London , I've been to Paris 
Even way out there to Tokyo 
Back home down in Georgia  to New Orleans 
But you always steal the show 
And just like that, girl, you got me froze 
Like a Nintendo 64 
If you never knew, well, now you know
Beautiful girls  all over the world 
I could be chasin', but my time would be wasted 
They got nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
Nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
They might say "Hi" , and I might say "Hey" 
But you shouldn't worry  about what they say 
'Cause they got nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
Nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
I'm always hearin' your name 
And no matter where I'm at
Girl, you make me wanna sing 
Whether a bus or a plane 
Or a car or a train 
No other girl's on my brain
And you the one to blame
Beautiful girls  all over the world 
I could be chasin' , but my time would be wasted 
They got nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
Nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
They might say "Hi" , and I might say "Hey" 
But you shouldn't worry about what they say 
'Cause they got nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you
Nothin' on you, baby
Na—na—na—nothin' on you, baby, na—nothin' on you

Must've spent thirty-five, forty-five thousand up in Tiffany's 
Got her badass kids runnin' 'round my whole crib
Like it's Chuck E. Cheese 
Put me in a jam with her ex-man in the UFC
Can't believe it

Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrists
And here I am all alone 
I'm so cold, I'm so cold
You got me out here
Smokin' out the window 
Singin', "How could she do this to me?"
Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me 
But I was wrong
To everybody, everybody, ooh
Just the other night, she was grippin' on me tight
Screamin', "Hercules" 
Got me in the club lookin' for a new love
Someone help me, please 
Baby, why you doin' this? Why you doin' this to me, girl?
Not to be dramatic, but I wanna die
This bitch got me payin' her rent, payin' for trips
Diamonds on her neck, diamonds on her wrists

I'm so cold, I'm so cold
You got me out here
Smokin' out the window 
Singin', "How could she do this to me?" 
Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me 
But I was wrong 
'Cause she belong 
To everybody, everybody 
 Ooh
Look here, baby, I hope you find whatever it is that you need
But I also hope that your triflin' ass is walkin' 'round barefoot in these streets
Girl, it breaks my heart that you ain't right here with me
Now I gotta give you back 
To the city, oh, you got me
Smokin' out the window 
Singin', "How could she do this to me?" 
Oh, I thought that girl belonged to only me 
But I was wrong 
'Cause she belong 
To everybody, everybody 
 Ooh

Cutlass sittin' high , I feel like I can fly 
So fresh to death, it's crazy, feel like I can die

Same bed, but it feels just a little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio, but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
It all just sounds like 
Mm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Shoulda gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancin'
But she's dancin' with another man
Uh, my pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made, oh
And that haunts me every time I close my eyes
It all just sounds like 
Mm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should've bought you flowers
And held your hand
Shoulda gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancin'
But she's dancin' with another man
I'll be the first to say that
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know
I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause I remember how much you love to dance
Do all the things I should've done
When I was your man
Do all the things I should've done
When I was your man

Or would it be a waste, even if I knew my place?
Should I leave it there?
Should I give up or should I just keep chasing pavements
Even if it leads nowhere?

Waiting as my heart drops
And my back begins to tingle

You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her
These days when I see you
You make it look like I'm see-through
Do tell me why you waste our time
When your heart ain't in it and you're not satisfied
You know I know just how you feel
I'm starting to find myself feeling that way too when
You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her
Time and time again, I play the role of fool
And even in the daylight when you think that
I try to look for things I hear but our eyes never find
Though I do know how you play
You grace me with your cold shoulder
Whenever you look at me and wish I was her
You shower me with words made of knives

So go easy on me

When we are both so deeply stuck in our ways
You can't deny how hard I've tried
I changed who I was to put you both first
But now I give up
Go easy on mе, baby

Didn't get the chance to
Feel thе world around me

And the highest hopes

To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside
At least, I can say that I've tried
To tell you I'm sorry for breaking your heart
But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
Hello, how are you?
It's so typical of me to talk about myself, I'm sorry
I hope that you're well
Did you ever make it out of that town where nothing ever happened?
It's no secret that the both of us
Are running out of time
So hello from the other side 
I must've called a thousand times 
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done

I was wondering if after all these years you'd like to meet
To go over everything
They say that time's supposed to heal ya, but I ain't done much healing
Hello, can you hear me?
I'm in California dreaming about who we used to be
When we were younger and free
I've forgotten how it felt before the world fell at our feet
There's such a difference between us
And a million miles
Hello from the other side
I must've called a thousand times
To tell you I'm sorry for everything that I've done
But when I call, you never seem to be home
Hello from the outside

But it don't matter, it clearly doesn't tear you apart anymore
I've been walking in the same way as I did
Missing out the cracks in the pavement
And tutting my heel and strutting my feet
"Is there anything I can do for you, dear?"
"Is there anyone I could call?"
"No and thank you, please madame
I ain't lost, just wandering"
Ooh, the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders now
I like it in the city
When the air is so thick and opaque
I love it to see everybody in short skirts, shorts and shades
I like it in the city when two worlds collide
You get the people and the government
Everybody taking different sides
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Shows that we ain't gonna take it
Shows that we ain't gonna stand shit
Shows that we are united
Ooh, the people I've met, yeah
Are the wonders of my world
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of my world
Yeah, of my world

3 ContributorsI can`t make you love me LyricsTurn down the lights
Turn down the bed
Turn down these voices inside my head
Lay down with me, tell me no lies
Just hold me close, don't patronize
Cause i can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart and i'll feel the power
But you won't, no you won't
Cause i can't make you love me if you don't
I'll close my eyes, then i won't see
The love you don't feel when you're holdin me
Mornin will come and i'll do what's right
Just give me till then to give up this fight
And i will give up this fight
Cause i can't make you love me if you don't
You can't make your heart feel something it won't
Here in the dark, in these final hours
I will lay down my heart and i'll feel the power

>>>I Drink Wine Adele
<sos>
How can one become so bounded by choices that somebody else makes?
How come we've both become a version of a person we don't even like?
We're in love with the world, but the world just wants to bring us down
By puttin' ideas in our heads that corrupt our hearts somehow
When I was a child, every single thing could blow my mind
Soaking it all up for fun, but now I only soak up wine
They say to play hard, you work hard, find balance in the sacrifice
And yet I don't know anybody who's truly satisfied
You better believe I'm tryin' 
To keep climbin' 
But the higher we climb feels like we're both none the wiser
So I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop tryin' to be somebody else
So we can love each other for free
Everybody wants somethin', you just want me
Why am I obsessin' about the things I can't control?
Why am I seekin' approval from people I don't even know?
In these crazy times, I hope to find somethin' I can cling on to
'Cause I need some substance in my life, somethin' real, somethin' that feels true
You better believe for you, I've cried 
High tides 
'Cause I want you so bad, but you can't fight fire with fire, oh
So I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop tryin' to be somebody else
Oh, I just want to love you, love you for free
Everybody wants somethin' from me, you just want me
Listen, I know how low I can go, I give as good as I get
You get the brunt of it all 'cause you're all I've got left
Oh, I hope in time 
We both will find peace of mind 
Sometimes, the road less travelled is a road best left behind
Well, I hope I learn to get over myself
Stop tryin' to be somebody else
Oh, I just want to love you, love you for free, yeah
'Cause everybody wants somethin' from me, you just want me
You better believe I'm tryin' 
To keep climbin' 
But the higher we climb, feels like we're both none the wiser
The only regret I have
I wish that it was just at a different time
A most turbulent period of my life
Why would I put that on you?
That's just, like, a very heavy thing to have to talk about
But because of that period of time
Even though it was so much fun
I didn't get to go on and make new memories with him
There was just memories in a big storm
<eos>
>>>Love in the Dark Adele
<sos>
Take your eyes off of me so I can leave
I'm far too ashamed to do it with you watching me
This is never ending, we have been here before
But I can't stay this time 'cause I don't love you anymore
Please stay where you are, don't come any closer
Don't try to change my mind, I'm being cruel to be kind
I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Baby, we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, everything changed me
You have given me something that I can't live without
You mustn't underestimate that when you are in doubt
But I don't want to carry on like everything is fine
The longer we ignore it all, the more that we will fight
Please don't fall apart, I can't face your breaking heart
I'm trying to be brave, stop asking me to stay
I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Baby, we're already defeated
Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, everything changed me
We're not the only ones
I don't regret a thing
Every word I've said
You know I'll always mean
It is the world to me
That you are in my life
But I want to live and not just survive
That's why I can't love you in the dark
It feels like we're oceans apart
There is so much space between us
Baby, we're already defeated
'Cause ah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah, everything changed me
And I-I-I-I-I don't think you can save me

When the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love
I know you haven't made your mind up yet
But I will never do you wrong
I've known it from the moment that we met
No doubt in my mind where you belong
I'd go hungry, I'd go black and blue
I'd go crawling down the avenue
Know there's nothing that I wouldn't do
To make you feel my love
The storms are raging on the rollin' sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain't seen nothing like me yet
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
Nothing that I wouldn't do
Go to the ends of the earth for you
To make you feel my love
To make you feel my love

I let my heart decide the way
When I was young
Deep down, I must have always known
That this would be inevitable
To earn my stripes, I'd have to pay
And bare my soul
I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes, I just feel it's only me
Who can't stand the reflection that they see
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown
But that was a million years ago
When I walk around all of the streets
Where I grew up and found my feet
They can't look me in the eye
It's like they're scared of me
I try to think of things to say
Like a joke or a memory
But they don't recognize me now
In the light of day
I know I'm not the only one
Who regrets the things they've done
Sometimes, I just feel it's only me
Who never became who they thought they'd be
I wish I could live a little more
Look up to the sky, not just the floor
I feel like my life is flashing by
And all I can do is watch and cry
I miss the air, I miss my friends
I miss my mother, I miss it when
Life was a party to be thrown

Said I wouldn't call, but I lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now

Sometimes I feel lonely in the arms of your touch

But, it's in my roots, in my veins

We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Yeah send my love to your new lover, hug her
Tell her she the greatest and you’ll never bug her
We had a good time and a nice long summer
But it’s time to unhitch because you met another
I told you that I’m all for you and I’ll be here to support you
And it’s time that I cut this off because I no longer court you
Damn, it’s time to let go
All those lovey dovey memories, girl you even called me beau
I'm giving you up
I've forgiven it all
You set me free
Send my love to your new lover
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
Send my love to your new lover
We gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
If you're ready, if you're ready 
If you're ready, I am ready 
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more
If you're ready, if you're ready 
If you're ready, I am ready 
We've gotta let go of all of our ghosts
We both know we ain't kids no more

>>>Set Fire to the Rain Adele
<sos>
I let it fall, my heart
And as it fell, you rose to claim it
It was dark, and I was over
Until you kissed my lips and you saved me
My hands, they were strong
But my knees were far too weak
To stand in your arms
Without falling to your feet
But there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
When I lay with you
I could stay there, close my eyes
Feel you here forever
You and me together, nothing is better
'Cause there's a side to you
That I never knew, never knew
All the things you'd say
They were never true, never true
And the games you'd play
You would always win, always win
But I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When we fell, somethin' died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time
Sometimes, I wake up by the door
That heart you caught must be waitin' for you
Even now, when we're already over
I can't help myself from lookin' for you
I set fire to the rain
Watched it pour as I touched your face
Well, it burned while I cried
'Cause I heard it screamin' out your name
I set fire to the rain
And I threw us into the flames
When we fell, somethin' died
'Cause I knew that that was the last time

This is the end
Hold your breath and count to ten
Feel the Earth move, and then
Hear my heart burst again
For this is the end
I've drowned and dreamt this moment
So overdue, I owe them
Swept away, I'm stolen
Let the sky fall when it crumbles
We will stand tall
Face it all together
Let the sky fall
We will stand tall
Face it all together at Skyfall
Skyfall is where we start
A thousand miles and poles apart
Where worlds collide and days are dark
You may have my number, you can take my name
But you'll never have my heart
Let the sky fall 
When it crumbles 
We will stand tall 
Face it all together
Let the sky fall 
When it crumbles 
We will stand tall 
Face it all together at Skyfall
Let the sky fall
We will stand tall

We will stand tall
Where you go I go
What you see I see
I know I'd never be me without the security
Of your loving arms keeping me from harm
Put your hand in my hand and we'll stand
Let the sky fall 
When it crumbles 
We will stand tall 
Face it all together
Let the sky fall 
When it crumbles 
We will stand tall 
Face it all together at Skyfall
Let the sky fall

I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me, it isn't over
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead

>>>That's It, I Quit, I'm Movin' On Adele

When we used to say goodnight
I'd always kiss and hold you tight
But lately you don't seem to care
You close the door
And leave me standing there
The other night we had a date
And you showed up two hours late
And though your hair was all in place
Somebody smeared their lipstick on your face
Oh, they smeared it
Yeah that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on
You made me want you
You made me leave you
You made me tumble and fall
But if I can't have you the way I want you
I don't want you at all
Baby, I can take a lot
'Cause I love everything you got
Though your kisses fill me
So if you got someone else
Oh, that you know
Yeah that's it honey

Oh, that you know
Yeah that's it honey
I quit I'm movin' on
I built a house for a love to grow
I was so young that it was hard to know
I'm as lost now as I was back then
Always make a mess of everything
It's about time that I face myself
All I do is bleed into someone else
Painting walls with all my secret tears
Filling rooms with all my hopes and fears
I'll never learn if I never leap
I'll always yearn if I never speak
To be loved and love at the highest count
Means to lose all the things I can't live without
Let it be known that I will choose to lose
It's a sacrifice, but I can't live a lie
Let it be known, let it be known that I tried
I'm so afraid, but I'm open wide
I'll be the one to catch myself this time
Tryna learn to lean into it all
Ain't it funny how the mighty fall?
Looking back, I don't regret a thing
Yeah, I took some bad turns that I am owning
I'll stand still and let the storm pass by
Keep my heart safe till the time feels right
I'll never learn if I never leap
I'll always yearn if I never speak
To be loved and love at the highest count
Means to lose all the things I can't live without
Let it be known that I will choose to lose
It's a sacrifice, but I can't live a lie
Let it be known
Let it be known that I cried for you
Even started lying to you
What a thing to do
All because I wanted
To be loved and love at the highest count
Means to lose all the things I can't live without
Let it be known, known, known
That I will choose, I will lose
It's a sacrifice, but I can't live a lie
Let it be known
Let it be known that I tried, that I tried
Let it be known that I tried

>>>Turning Tables Adele

Close enough to start a war
All that I have is on the floor
God only knows what we're fighting for
All that I say, you always say more
I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe
So I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't rescue you to just desert me
I can't give you the heart you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
Under haunted skies, I see you, ooh
Where love is lost, your ghost is found
I braved a hundred storms to leave you
As hard as you try, no, I will never be knocked down
I can't keep up with your turning tables
Under your thumb, I can't breathe
So I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't rescue you to just desert me
I can't give you the heart you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
Next time, I'll be braver
I'll be my own saviour
When the thunder calls for me
Next time, I'll be braver
I'll be my own saviour
Standing on my own two feet
I won't let you close enough to hurt me
No, I won't rescue you to just desert me
I can't give you the heart you think you gave me
It's time to say goodbye to turning tables
Turn, no, no-oh, mmm

>>>Water and a Flame Adele
<sos>
Seven days has gone so fast
I really thought the pain would pass
Its been nearly an hour since I thought of you
Cause you're not answering the phone
I'd settle for a busy tone
At least by that I know, that you're okay
A girl like you ain't meant to go away
And now youre gone, there's nothing else I want
And now that its over, there's nothing else I want
What have I done, looks I was wrong
Is everything really meant to change?
I guess were like water and a flame
Im tired of this empty house
I need a drink to get me out
A couple more till I forget your name
I saw a boy that looked like you
I didn't quite know what to do
I took a power of will to break my stare
I realized what I wanted wasn't there
And now youre gone, there's nothing else I want
And now that its over, there's nothing else I want
What have I done, looks like I was wrong
Is everything really meant to change?
I guess were like water and a flame
Daniel: If you see me coming
Adele: I look away, I look away
Daniel: And if your minds made up
Adele: I look away, I will look away
Daniel: If you worry about..
Adele: Im ok, Im ok, yes I am
Daniel: All this sorrow and this pain is gonna go away
And now you're gone, there's nothing else I want
And now that its over, there's nothing else I want
What have I done, looks I was wrong
Is everything really meant to change?
I guess were like water and a flame

If you're not the one for me
Then how come I can bring you to your knees?
If you're not the one for me
Why do I hate the idea of being free?
And if I'm not the one for you
You've gotta stop holding me the way you do
Oh honey, if I’m not the one for you
Why have we been through what we have been through?
It's so cold out here in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
What are you waiting for?
You never seem to make it through the door
And who are you hiding from?
It ain't no life to live like you're on the run
Have I ever asked for much?
The only thing that I want is your love
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge
It's so cold in your wilderness
I want you to be my keeper
But not if you are so reckless
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
If you're gonna let me down, let me down gently
Don't pretend that you don't want me
Our love ain't water under the bridge
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge 
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge 
Say it ain't so, say it ain't so
Say that our love ain't water under the bridge

>>>When We Were Young Adele
<sos>
Everybody loves the things you do
From the way you talk to the way you move
Everybody here is watching you
'Cause you feel like home, you're like a dream come true
But if by chance you're here alone
Can I have a moment before I go?
'Cause I've been by myself all night long
Hoping you're someone I used to know
You look like a movie
You sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
I was so scared to face my fears
Nobody told me that you'd be here
And I swear you'd moved overseas
That's what you said when you left me
You still look like a movie
You still sound like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
It's hard to admit that everything just takes me back
To when you were there, to when you were there
And a part of me keeps holding on just in case it hasn't gone
'Cause I still care, do you still care?
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
My God, this reminds me
Of when we were young
Let me photograph you in this light
In case it is the last time that we might
Be exactly like we were before we realised
We were sad of getting old, it made us restless
Oh, I'm so mad I'm getting old, it makes me reckless
It was just like a movie
It was just like a song
When we were young

>>>California King Bed Rihanna
<sos>
Chest to chest 
Nose to nose 
We were always just that close 
Wrist to wrist 
Toe to toe 
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose
So how come when I reach out my finger
It feels like more than distance between us?
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
Eye to eye 
Cheek to cheek 
You were sleeping next to me 
With the curtains drawn
And a little last night on these sheets
So how come when I reach out my fingers
It seems like more than distance between us?
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then, my eyes got wetter
So confused, wanna ask you if you love me
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming
Hey, hey, hey, hey
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
Been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me

Pretty motherfucker with the Mossberg
Jiggy motherfucker at my concerts
I'm wearin' fox furs, rockin' Oxfords
Eatin' oxtails, sippin' Cockspur
Silly motherfuckers lookin' awkward
So much dick ridin' that my cock hurt 
So we got purp', and we got work
Tell Ri-Ri I go re—retarded
On a remix had to re-record it
On a CD, DVD, and TV, MP3, come see me for it
I go cuckoo for your coucou
Your flying fish is my favorite dish
Won't hear crickets when I crick it
Hit it, play games like soccer when we kick it
No one can do you the way that I do
Boy, I want 
Suck my cockiness, lick my persuasion
Eat my words and then swallow your pride down, down
Place my wants and needs over your resistance
And then you come around, you come around, you come around
I want you to be my sex slave 
Be one with my feminine 
They mad at Rihanna game 
She may be the queen of hearts
But I'ma be the queen of your body parts
No one can do you the way that I do
Boy, I want 
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it

Suck my cockiness, lick my persuasion
Eat my words and then swallow your pride down, down
Place my wants and needs over your resistance
And then you come around, you come around, you come around
I can be your dominatrix 
Enter my diamond matrix 
Make me your priority 
She may be the queen of hearts
But I'ma be the queen of your body parts
No one can do you the way that I do
Boy, I want 
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it, I love it when you eat it
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it
I love it when you eat it, I love it when you eat it
Hold me down, beat it like a bully
Beat my drum, drum, like a drumline boogie 
Dive head first if you wanna
Sing to my body, hold me tight Mr. Lover 
Do it like I, do it like I say
Keep it up, boy, we can do this all day
Be my Harlem and me Saint-Tropez
Never found nobody that will do it this way
No one can do you the way that I do
Boy, I want 
I love it, I love it, I love it when you eat it

Dark and I'm burning a rose

I'm torn apart and you know
What you did to me was a crime
And I let you reach me one more time
Your love was breaking the law
But I needed a witness 
So wake me up when it's over
It don't make any difference 
Will it ever be solved
Or am I taking the fall?
Truth was there all along
Tell me, how did we miss it?
We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love
But love blinded eyes, couldn't see 
And then I tried to cage it
But your love ain't the kind that you can keep
Release me now 'cause I did my time
Of this cold case love
My heart's no longer cold and confined

Handin' out highs to less fortunate
I do advise you
Run it back, run it on back
When you're breakin' it down for me
'Cause I can't hear you
Two times, run it on back
Will it ever make sense to me?
I got to do things my own way, darlin'
Will you ever let me?
Will you ever respect me? No
Do things my own way, darlin'
You should just let me
Why you ain't ever let me grow?

I can't get no peace of mind
When I look outside my window
I can't get no peace of mind, oh
Let me cover your shit in glitter
I could make it gold, gold
Heard you tryna sell your soul, baby
Word on the street, you run it low lately
I needed you to please give my reflection a break
From the face it's seein' now
Ooh, darlin', would you mind givin' my reflection a break
From the pain it's feelin' now?
I got to do things my own way, darlin'
You should just let me
Will you ever respect me? No

Paintin' they own pictures, then they crop me in
But I will remain where the top begins
'Cause I am not a word, I am not a line
I am not a girl that could ever be defined
I am not fly, I am levitation
I represent an entire generation
I hear the criticism loud and clear
That is how I know that the time is near
See we become alive in the time of fear
And I ain't got no motherfuckin' time to spare
Cry my eyes out for days upon days
Such a heavy burden placed upon me
But when you go hard, your nays become yays
Yankee stadium with Jays and Kanyes
I came to win, to fight
To conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive
To prosper, to rise
Get ready for it
I came to win
Get ready for it
I came to win, to fight
To conquer, to thrive
I came to win, to survive
To prosper, to rise

You say you love me
But they feel like words to me
Well, this just ain't working
Stop thinking you can run over me
Off to a foreign place
If I can't see what's in front of me
It's a mystery, well, then apparently
Things just ain't the same
And I'm ready for change
Go on, be gone
Bye bye, so long
Can't you see that you're fading, fading, fading?
Fa-a-ading away, away, away, away
I opened up my eyes and I finally realized
Today, today, it's too late
Put a sock in it, just stop running your mouth
Got my mind made up, I ain't coming back again
No way, no way, no way, no way
'Cause I'm so fed up, boy, you got me messed up
If we hooking back up, don't press your luck today, today
I'm blowing you away, yeah, yeah
Things just ain't the same
And I'm ready for change
Go on, be gone
Can't you see that you're fading, fading, fading?
Fa-a-ading away, away, away, away
I opened up my eyes and I finally realized
Today, today, it's too late
Saw you turn into a ghost right in front of my eyes
Tell me, what's a girl to do when she's crying inside?
I'm about to go insane, I'm jumping off this train
Whether wrong or right, I'll be gone by night
Can't you see that you're fading, fading, fading?
Fa-a-ading away, away, away, away
I opened up my eyes and I finally realized
Today, today, it's too late
Man, I can understand how it might be
Kinda hard to love a girl like me
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
I just wanted you to know
Swizz told me let the beat rock 
For all my Southside niggas that know me best
I feel like me and Taylor might still have sex
Why? I made that bitch famous 
I made that bitch famous
For all the girls that got dick from Kanye West
If you see 'em in the streets give 'em Kanye's best
Why? They mad they ain't famous 
They mad they still nameless 
Her man in the store tryna try his best
But he just can't seem to get Kanye fresh
But we still hood famous 
Yeah, we still hood famous
I just wanted you to know
I've loved you better than your own kin did
From the very start
I don't blame you much for wanting to be free
Wake up, Mr. West! Oh, he's up!
I just wanted you to know
I be Puerto Rican day parade floatin'
That Benz Marina Del Rey coastin'
She in school to be a real estate agent
Last month I helped her with the car payment
Young and we alive, whoo!
We never gonna die, whoo!
I just copped a jet to fly over personal debt
Put one up in the sky
The sun is in my eyes, whoo!
Woke up and felt the vibe, whoo!
No matter how hard they try, whoo!
We never gonna die

Tryna forgive you for abandoning me
Prayin', but I think I'm still an angel away
Angel away, yeah, it's strange in a way
Maybe that is why I chase strangers away
They got they guns out aimin' at me
But I become Neo when they aimin' at me
Me, me, me against them
Me against enemies, me against friends
Somehow, they both seem to become one
A sea full of sharks and they all smell blood

Higher, higher, more fire

But you won't let me
You upset me, girl, and then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden, I forget 
I can't remember what you did
But I hate it...
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long, that's wrong
But I hate it
You know exactly how to touch
So that I don't wanna fuss and fight no more
Said I despise that I adore you
And I hate how much I love you, boy 
I can't stand how much I need you 
And I hate how much I love you, boy 
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so
Ooh, and you completely know the power that you have

Said that it's not fair
How you take advantage of the fact
Love you beyond the reason why 
And it just ain't right, oh

I can't stand how much I need you 
And I hate how much I love you, girl 
But I just can't let you go 
But I hate that I love you so
One of these days, maybe your magic won't affect me 
And your kiss won't make me weak
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me
So you'll probably always have a spell on me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Now as the summer fades, I let you slip away
You say I'm not your type, but I can make you sway
It makes you burn to learn you're not the only one
I'd let you be if you put down your blazing gun
Now you've gone somewhere else far away
I don't know if I will find you 
But you feel my breath on your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you 
'Cause you keep me coming back for more 
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight, oh
Sometimes you move so well, it's hard not to give in
I'm lost, I can't tell where you end and I begin
It makes you burn to learn I'm with another man
I wonder if he's half the lover that I am
Now you've gone somewhere else far away
I don't know if I will find you 
But you feel my breath on your neck
Can't believe I'm right behind you 
'Cause you keep me coming back for more 
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight
Baby, baby, please believe me
Find it in your heart to reach me
Promise not to leave me behind 
Take me down, but take it easy
Make me think, but don't deceive me
Torture me by taking your time
'Cause you keep me coming back for more
And I feel a little better than I did before
If I never see your face again, I don't mind
'Cause we got much further than I thought we'd get tonight
Keep me coming back for more 
And I feel a little better than I did before 
If I never see your face again, I don't mind

Light up the dark if you follow your heart
And it will get better

And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it — "Wait!
Where you going?" — "I'm leaving you!" — "No, you ain't!
Come back!" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again
It's so insane, 'cause when it's goin' good, it's goin' great
I'm Superman with the wind at his back, she's Lois Lane
But when it's bad, it's awful, I feel so ashamed
I snapped, "Who's that dude?", I don't even know his name
I laid hands on her, I'll never stoop so low again
I guess I don't know my own strength
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
You ever love somebody so much you can barely breathe when you're with 'em?
You meet, and neither one of you even know what hit 'em
Got that warm fuzzy feelin', yeah, them chills, used to get 'em
Now you're gettin' fuckin' sick of lookin' at 'em?
You swore you'd never hit 'em, never do nothin' to hurt 'em
Now you're in each other's face
Spewin' venom in your words when you spit 'em
You push, pull each other's hair, scratch, claw, bit 'em
Throw 'em down, pin 'em
So lost in the moments when you're in 'em
It's the rage that took over, it controls you both
So they say you're best to go your separate ways
Guess that they don't know ya
'Cause today, that was yesterday, yesterday is over
It's a different day, sound like broken records playin' over
But you promised her, next time you'll show restraint
You don't get another chance, life is no Nintendo game
But you lied again
Now you get to watch her leave out the window
Guess that's why they call it window pane
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Now, I know we said things, did things that we didn't mean
Then we fall back into the same patterns, same routine
But your temper's just as bad as mine is, you're the same as me
When it comes to love, you're just as blinded, baby, please
Come back, it wasn't you, baby, it was me
Maybe our relationship isn't as crazy as it seems
Maybe that's what happens when a tornado meets a volcano
All I know is I love you too much to walk away though
Come inside, pick up your bags off the sidewalk
Don't you hear sincerity in my voice when I talk?
Told you this is my fault, look me in the eyeball
Next time I'm pissed, I'll aim my fist at the drywall
Next time? There won't be no next time!
I apologize, even though I know it's lies
I'm tired of the games, I just want her back, I know I'm a liar
If she ever tries to fuckin' leave again, I'ma tie her
To the bed and set this house on fire, just gonna—
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn?
Well, that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry?
Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie

Well, that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I can't tell you what it really is, I can only tell you what it feels like
And right now, there's a steel knife in my windpipe
I can't breathe, but I still fight while I can fight
As long as the wrong feels right, it's like I'm in flight
High off her love, drunk from her hate
It's like I'm huffin' paint and I love her, the more I suffer, I suffocate
And right before I'm about to drown, she resuscitates me
She fuckin' hates me, and I love it — "Wait!
Where you going?" — "I'm leaving you!" — "No, you ain't!
Come back!" — We're runnin' right back, here we go again

Ain't nothin' wrong with it
I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I need love and affection
And I hope I'm not sounding too desperate
I need love and affection
Oh baby, I'm not asking for the world, maybe
You can give me what I want, baby
Come hold me tight and when I'm drowning, save me
Give it to me on a daily
If I'm your girl, say my name, boy
Let me know I'm in control
We both grown so how we feel we can let it show
 Won't play around
 Wanna lay you down
 I need you now
I need you now, oh
I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I need love and affection
And I hope I'm not sounding too desperate
I need love and affection
Boy, lately you've been stingy with your time
I'm wondering, If I'm on your mind
Boy, I just wanna be in your possession
Saying I'm the one you want
So come express it
Don't slip, don't slip
'Cause a nigga might push up on it
Don't really wanna lose this moment
Why window shop when you own this?
 Don't put it down
 Don't fuck around
 I want you now
I want you now, oh
I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I need love and affection
And I hope I'm not sounding too desperate
I need love and affection
Can you love me for poor? 
I'm searching for my soul 
Who ever turned you cold? 
You need to let him know
I can work miracles
I'll work your physical 
And when I love you close
You can feel my heart
Beating through my clothes
I don't wanna give you the wrong impression
I need love and affection
And I hope I'm not sounding too desperate
I need love and affection

I didn't mean to end his life, I know it wasn't right
I can't even sleep at night, can't get it off my mind
I need to get out of sight 'fore I end up behind bars
What started out as a simple altercation
Turned into a real sticky situation
Me just thinking on the time that I'm facing
Makes me wanna cry
'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Coulda been somebody's son
And I took his heart when
I pulled out that gun
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
It's a twenty-two, I call her Peggy Sue
When she fits right down in my shoes
What you expect me to do if you're playing me for a fool?
I will lose my cool and reach for my firearm
I didn't mean to lay him down
But it's too late to turn back now
Don't know what I was thinking
Now he's no longer living
So I'm 'bout to leave town, ayy-uh
'Cause I didn't mean to hurt him
Coulda been somebody's son
And I took his heart when
I pulled out that gun
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down
In front of a big ol' crowd
Oh, mama, mama, mama
I just shot a man down 
Look, I'd never thought I'd do it
Never thought I'd do it
Never thought I'd do it, oh gosh
Whatever happened to me?
Ever happened to me?
Why did I pull the trigger, pull the trigger
Pull the trigger, boom
And end a nigga, end a nigga life so soon?
When mi pull the trigger, pull the trigger
Pull it pon' you
Somebody tell me what I'm gonna, what I'm gonna do? Eh
Mi say wah man down
A weh mi say
When mi went downtown
'Cause now I am criminal, criminal, criminal
Oh Lord, oh mercy, now I am a criminal
Tell the judge please gimme minimal
Run outta town, none a dem can see mi now, see mi now

I got an attitude
B****** say I act rude
Cause I be answering back
I won’t take haters chat
I got an attitude
B****** say I act rude
Cause of my body language
I want you to love me
Like I’m a hot ride
Keep thinking of me
Make me your only girl for the night
Blame it on my prima donna attitude
Prima donna, prima donna
Blame it on my prima donna attitude
You might also like
I got a point of view
That comes off as rude
Cause I say what I want
I don’t give a f***
I got a point of view
That comes off as rude
A whole lot of you
Want you to take me like a thief in the night
Hold me like a pillow, make me feel right
Like the only girl tonight
Prima donna, prima donna
Blame it on my prima donna attitude
Take me for a ride, ride
Oh baby, take me high, high
Let me make you first
Oh make it last all night
Take me for a ride, ride
Oh baby, take me high, high
Let me make you first
Make it last all night
Want you to make me feel like I'm the only girl in the world
Like I'm the only one that you'll ever love
Like I'm the only one who knows your heart
Only girl in the world...
Like I'm the only one that's in command
Cause I'm the only one who understands how to make you feel like a man
Only girl in the world
Girl in the world
Only girl in the world
Girl in the world

Want my own TV production company
So tell Harpo to hit me, Celie
Anyway, RiRi, what rhymes with your name freely?

Do you wanna sit on the back while I wheelie?
Really? Really? No, for real, really?
Laid out on the beach, they be feeding me my catfishes

Baby, baby, when we first met
I never felt something so strong
You were like my lover and my best friend
All wrapped into one, with a ribbon on it
And all of a sudden, you went and left
I didn't know how to follow
It's like a shot that spun me around and now my heart left
I feel so empty and hollow
And I'll never give myself to another the way I gave it to you
Don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame
And now I feel like, oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
I should've never let you enter my door
Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it

It's like I checked into rehab
And baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby, you're my disease
Damn, ain't it crazy when you're love swept?
You'll do anything for the one you love
'Cause anytime that you needed me, I'd be there
It's like you were my favorite drug
The only problem is that you was using me
In a different way that I was using you
But now that I know it's not meant to be
You gotta go, I gotta wean myself off of you
And I'll never give myself to another the way I gave it to you
Don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you? 
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame
'Cause now I feel like, oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
I should've never let you enter my door 
Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it 
'Cause now I'm using like I bleed 
It's like I checked into rehab 
And baby, you're my disease 
It's like I checked into rehab
And baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab 
'Cause baby, you're my disease 
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby, you're my disease 
Now ladies, gimme that
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh, oh, oh-oh

Feel it comin' in the air

Only thing that's on my mind 
Is who's gon' run this town tonight 
Is who's gon' run this town tonight 
We gon' run this town
We are, yeah, I said it: we are
This is Roc Nation, pledge your allegiance
Get your fatigues on, all black everything
Black cards, black cars, all black everything
And our girls are blackbirds ridin' with they Dillingers
I get more in depth if you boys really real enough
This is la Familia, I'll explain later
But for now, let me get back to this paper
I'm a couple bands down and I'm tryin' to get back
I gave Doug a grip and lost a flip for five stacks
Yeah, I'm talkin' 5 comma, 6 zeros, dot zero, here Doug
Back to runnin' circles round niggas, now we squared up
Life's a game, but it's not fair 
I break the rules, so I don't care 
So I keep doin' my own thang
Walkin' tall against the rain

On the table, screamin', "Fuck the other side! They're jealous!"
We got a banquette full of broads, they got a table full of fellas
Yeah, and they ain't spendin' no cake
They should throw their hand in 'cause they ain't got no spades
Yeah, my whole team got dough
So my banquette is lookin' like Millionaires' Row
Life's a game, but it's not fair

This the fast life, we are on a crash course
What you think I rap for, to push a fuckin' Rav 4?
But I know that if I stay stunting
All these girls only gon' want one thing
I can spend my whole life Good Will Hunting
Only good gon' come is this good when I'm cumming
She got a ass that'll swallow up a G-string
And up top, ungh, two bee stings
And I'm beasting off the Riesling
And my nigga just made it out the precinct
We give a damn about the drama that your dude bring
I'm just tryin' to change the color on your mood ring

>>>Sledgehammer Rihanna
<sos>
I hit a wall, I never felt so low, so low
Like a waterfall, my tears dropped to the floor, the floor
They left a swimming pool of salted crimes, crimes
Oh, what could I do to change your mind?
I'm bracing for the pain and I am letting go
I'm using all my strength to get out of this hole
I hit a wall, I thought that I would hurt myself
Oh I was sure, your words would leave me unconscious
And on the floor I'd be lying cold, lifeless
But I hit a wall, I hit 'em all, watch the fall
You're just another brick and I'm a sledgehammer
Yeah I hit a wall, I prayed that I would make it through, make it through
I can survive a life that's without you, that's without you, yeah
And I will rise up from the ashes now, the ashes now
Oh, the sparrow flies with just the crumbs of loving spilled, yeah
I was bracing for the pain and then I let it go
I gathered all my strength and I found myself whole
I hit a wall, I thought that I would hurt myself
Oh I was sure, your words would leave me unconscious
And on the floor I'd be lying cold, lifeless
But I hit a wall, I hit 'em all, watch the fall
You're just another brick and I'm a sledgehammer
You're just another brick and I'm a sledgehammer

>>>Stay Rihanna

All along, it was a fever
A cold sweat, hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air, said, "Show me something"
He said, "If you dare, come a little closer"
'Round and around and around and around, we go
Oh, now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay
It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take, it's given
'Round and around and around and around, we go
Oh, now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
And I want you to stay
The reason I hold on
'Cause I need this hole gone
Well, funny you're the broken one
But I'm the only one who needed saving
'Cause when you never see the light
It's hard to know which one of us is caving
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay

When the sky falls and the earth quakes
We gon' put this back together
Sak Pase, my Port-Au-Princes
My Haitian Gods and all of my Princesses
Our condolences as you fightin' against this
We’re right by your side while we tryin' to make sense of this
Heavenly father help us see through these problems
And for those that's left, accept them into your garden
So here’s my theory, the country’s already starvin'
So we sacrificed many to shed light on all of them
God please pardon, I speak from the heart
It's the only way I see this tragedy befall on them
So let's get involved with them, hand to hand with them
Arm to arm with them 'til they get strong again
When the sky falls…
Can’t wait until tomorrow
Haiti a Mi Amor
Not gonna leave you stranded, alone, alone
Learn from the past, New Orleans was flooded
So we know we just can’t rely on the government
We under the rubble again, here we go rumbling when
When we gon' catch a break, my friend lost his mother, and then
And then, Carline lost her uncles and them
Buried with no caskets, they just put covers on them
And the tears fall, and we fight back
Story ain’t done, it can’t end like that
Nah, not like this, tomorrow’s survivors gonna carry on your name
You live on inside us, your memory’s alive with us
You inspired us, to rebuild this country, you just guide us
It’s not the angels that are on their way
Its not the bells of Santa Trinita
The people waiting in positions vacant
For hands to help not just to pray
Tu vas te relever
We gon' put this back together we won't break
We gon' put this back together we won't break

>>>Stupid in Love Rihanna
<sos>
Let me tell you something
Never, have I ever, been a size ten in my whole life
I left the engine running
I just came to see, what you would do if I
Gave you a chance to make things right
So I made it, even though Katy, told me that this would be nothing but a waste of time
And she was right, mmm
Don't understand it, blood on your hands
And still you insist on repeatedly trying to tell me lies
And I just don't know why, oh
This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid 
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid
My new nickname is "You Idiot" 
Mmm, that's what my friends are calling me when
They see me yelling into my phone
They're telling me, "Let go, he is not the one"
I thought I saw your potential
Guess that's what made me dumb
He don't want it, not like you want it
Scheming and cheating, oh girl, why do you waste your time?
You know he ain't right
You're telling me this, I don't wanna listen
But you insist on repeatedly tryna tell me lies
And I just don't know why
This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid 
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid
Tryna make this work
But you act like a jerk
Silly of me to keep holding on 
But the dunce cap is off
You don't know what you've lost
And you won't realize
Till I'm gone, gone, gone
That I was the one
Which one of us is really dumb?
Oh, no, no, no
I'm not stupid in love
This is stupid , I'm not stupid 
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid 
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid in love

>>>Take a Bow Rihanna

Oh, how about a round of applause?
Yeah, a standing ovation
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You look so dumb right now
Standing outside my house
You're so ugly when you cry
Please, just cut it out
And don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not
Baby, when I know you're only sorry you got caught
But you put on quite a show 
Really had me going
But, now, it's time to go 
That was quite a show 
But it's over now 
Go on and take a bow
Grab your clothes and get gone 
You better hurry up
Before the sprinklers come on 
Talkin' 'bout "Girl, I love you, you're the one"
This just looks like the re-run
Please, what else is on? 
And don't tell me you're sorry 'cause you're not 
Baby, when I know you're only sorry you got caught
But you put on quite a show 
Really had me going
But, now, it's time to go 
That was quite a show 
But it's over now 
Go on and take a bow
Oh, and the award for the best liar goes to you 
For making me believe
That you could be faithful to me
Let's hear your speech, oh
How 'bout a round of applause?
But you put on quite a show 
Really had me going
Now, it's time to go 
That was quite a show 
But it's over now 
Go on and take a bow

>>>Take Care Rihanna
<sos>
I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you 
I've loved and I've lost
I've asked about you and they told me things
But my mind didn't change and I still feel the same
What's a life with no fun? Please don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
They won't get you like I will, my only wish is I die real
'Cause that truth hurts and those lies heal
And you can't sleep thinkin' that he lies still
So you cry still, tears all in the pillowcase
Big girls all get a little taste, aw
Pushing me away so I give her space, aw
Dealin' with a heart that I didn't break
I'll be there for you, I would care for you
I keep thinking you just don't know
Tryna run from that, say you done with that
On your face, girl, it just don't show
When you're ready, just say you're ready
When all the baggage just ain't as heavy
And the party's over, just don't forget me
We'll change the pace and we'll just go slow
You won't ever have to worry
You won't ever have to hide
And you've seen all my mistakes
So look me in my eyes
'Cause if you let me
Here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you 
I've loved and I've lost
It's my birthday, I'll get high if I want to
Can't deny that I want you, but I'll lie if I have to
'Cause you don't say you love me
To your friends when they ask you
Even though we both know that you do, you do
One time, been in love one time
You and all your girls in the club one time
All so convinced that you're followin' your heart
'Cause your mind don't control what it does sometimes
We all have our nights, though, don't be so ashamed
I've had mine, you've had yours, we both know, we know
You hate bein' alone, well, you ain't the only one
You hate the fact that you bought the dream and they sold you one
You love your friends, but somebody should've told you somethin'
To save you, instead, they say
Don't, tell me, I don't care if you hurt
I don't, tell you, you don't care if you're true
Don't, tell me, I don't care if you hurt
I don't, tell you, you don't care if you're true
I know you've been hurt by someone else
I can tell by the way you carry yourself
If you let me, here's what I'll do
I'll take care of you 
I've loved and I've lost

I hear the pain in her voice
Then we danced underneath the candelabra
She takes the lead
That's when I saw it in her eyes, it's over
Then she said te amo
Then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no
She cried te amo
I told her I'm not gonna run away
But let me go
My soul is awry
I said te amo
Wish somebody'd tell me what she said
Don't it mean I love you?
Think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you?
Te amo, te amo
She's scared to breathe
I hold her hand, I got no choice, uh
Pulled me out on the beach, danced in the water
I start to leave
She's begging me and asking why it's over
Then she said te amo
Then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no
She cried te amo
I told her I'm not gonna run away
But let me go
My soul is awry
I said te amo
Wish somebody'd tell me what she said
Don't it mean I love you?
Think it means I love you
Don't it mean I love you?
Listen, we can dance
But you gotta watch your hands
Watch me all night
I’m moving through the light
That we all need love
And I'm not afraid
To feel the love, but I don't feel that way
Then she said te amo
Then she put her hand around me waist
I told her no
She cried te amo
I told her I'm not gonna run away
But let me go
My soul is awry

Wish somebody'd tell me what she said

Everybody light it up!
Come Rihanna light it up!

The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
She just my part time lover, pretty likkle ting
Nothing I would ever think about giving a ring
Nothing but a pretty likkle overnight fling
Even though she wanna be the queen to my king
She ain't nothing but a work for my ginseng
Someone I would use to bust my box spring
She would a number one, not di badda-bing
Bad man nah go badda wid di wife-wife ting
She gotta know she the girl on the side
On the left of the rest, number two on my mind
There's no way she could be my girl
But she steady tryna come into my world, not uh!
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
Yo! She's just my trophy piece, mi hot hot gyal
Never ever would I call her Ms. Offishall
Never ever would I bring her around my fam
She be crying on the phone but she knows who I am
Mr. Kardinal - voice of the people
Black Jays family our verses are lethal
I don't have time for the play play
She a good chick yo but I'm married to the game
Married to the fame, related to the paper
Tryna get my name put up on a skyscraper
There's no way she could be my wife
But she's steady tryna come into my life, not uh!
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
Those other girls ain't nothing like me
Just give me the chance and boy you will see
That I'm not the kinda girl
Who'll just get down like that
On the real, I ain't gonna front ya
The fox to a lot of hound dogs on the hunt
You the push to a lotta kush, rolling a blunt
You the hottest in the dance but you ain't what I want
I'm a business man! Tryna get the business
Just tryna wuk out ya physical fitness
There's no way you could get that ring
But I hear all the hotty-hotties in the place sing
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one
The tide is high but I'm holding on
I'm gonna be your number one

Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Look...I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to ask you if you're okay
My friends always feel the need to tell me things
Seems like they're just happier than us these days
These days I don't know how to talk to you
I don't know how to be there when you need me
It feels like the only time you see me
Is when you turn your head to the side and look at me differently
And last night I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it, oh
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
I don't know how to talk to you
I just know I found myself getting lost with you
Lately you just make me work too hard for you
Got me on flights overseas, and I still can't get across to you
And last night I think I lost my patience
Last night, I got high as your expectations
Last night, I came to a realization
And I hope you can take it
I hope you can take it, oh
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
Years go by too fast
I can't keep track
How long did we last?
I feel bad for asking
It can't end like this
We gotta take time with this
Cock up yuh bumper, sit down pon it
Let me see if this is something I can fix 
You got somebody other than me
Don't play the victim when you're with me
Free time is costing me more than it seems
And I wanna tell you my intentions
I wanna do the things that I mention
I wanna benefit from the friendship
I wanna get the late night message from you, from you
I put my hands around you
Gotta get a handle on you
Gotta get a handle on the fact that I
I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it
No, I'm too good to you
I'm way too good to you
You take my love for granted
I just don't understand it

Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you
Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you
Lost in the rock and roll
Got lost in a promise of a love I'd never know 
Shadows chased me far from home
I remember when my heart was filled with gold 
I've been burned, I've been burned, I've been burned
You've seen me lose control
It's not worth, it's not worth, it's not worth my soul
Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you
Lost my faith and trust
You and I know gold don't turn to rust 
I still swear that we can reign
Like the kings and queens of better yesterdays 
I've been burned, I've been burned, I've been burned
You've seen me lose control
It's not worth, it's not worth, it's not worth my soul
Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you
Where you gonna go?
Where you gonna run to, when you get to the edge of the night?
Its time you face the sky, ooh
Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you
Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you
Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you

>>>Unfaithful Rihanna
<sos>
Story of my life, searching for the right
But it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul 'cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in because I'm gone again
And to him, I just can't be true
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer
I feel it in the air as I'm doin' my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek as he reluctantly
Asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well
'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful

And I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer
A murderer, no, no, no
It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn
The wait is over, the wait is over
I pitch with a grenade
Swing away if you're feeling brave
There's so much power in my name
If you pop off and you say it
Stadium gon' do the wave
I'm such a fucking lady
You don't have to be so afraid
'Cause I got room up on my team
You can play but hold up
It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn
It's getting crowded over here
But babe, the wait is over
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win
The wait is over
Fumble, don't you fumble, that's a flag on the play
Babe, if you don't wanna then you don't have to wait
But together, we gon' be taking over
It's just the way
The game is played
It's best if you just
So you don't wanna wait?
I hate to hear that, such a shame
'Cause if you play it sideways, ain't no timeout in my game
I know you want to win
And you wish I would let you in
Get in line over here
You can play but hold up
It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn
It's getting crowded over here
But babe, the wait is over
Sometimes it takes a thousand tries to win
The wait is over
Fumble, don't you fumble, that's a flag on the play

But together, we gon' be taking over
It's just the way the game is played
It's best if you just wait your turn
Baby put the work in like a champion
But the crowd is screaming with their hands way up
Couldn't be with no one else, you're the only way I'll win
Baby got the whole world standing up
Damn, I'm glad I picked ya, took a chance on love
The time is now and now the wait is over
The wait is over, the wait is over
Just wait your turn
The wait is over, the wait is over

>>>We Found Love Rihanna
<sos>
It's like you're screaming, and no one can hear
You almost feel ashamed, that someone could be that important
That without them, you feel like nothing
No one will ever understand how much it hurts
You feel hopeless, like nothing can save you
And when it's over and it's gone
You almost wish you could have all that bad stuff back
So that you could have the good
Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive
It's the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go
We found love in a hopeless place
Shine a light through an open door
Love and life, I will divide
Turn away 'cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind
It's the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go
We found love in a hopeless place
Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

It's real late, 'bout a quarter to one
I'm thinkin' of everything that we've become
And I hate it, I thought we could make it
But I'm ready to dead this, just wanna forget about it
I saw her pictures and the letters she sent
You had me thinkin' you were out with your friends
I'm so foolish, play me like I'm stupid
'Cause I thought it was just you and I, oh
Now I look back on the time that we spent
And I see it in my mind playin' over and over again
'Cause boy, right now, you got me breakin' down
And I just can't figure out why, but this is what you said, boy

When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
Visions in my mind of the day that we met
You showed me things that I'll never forget
Took me swimmin' in the ocean
You had my head up in the clouds
Made me feel like I'm floating, yeah
You think I'm playin' when you know it's the truth
Nobody else can do it quite like I do
All my kisses  and my lovin' 
But ain't nobody better than us, yeah, yeah
Now I look back on the time that we spent

But you and I know it's not that easy to let go
Of everything that we planned
And start all over again, hey
Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it
I won't forget how you do it
My sweet baby, this is where the game ends now
Somehow wanna believe you and me
We can figure it out
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
Gonna make you say, boy
I wish that you could hold me when I'm lonely
When I need someone to talk to, you would phone me
Just like everything you told me
Boy, you forgot about the promises you made me
And now we'll let the memories just fade away

I've been ignoring this big lump in my throat
I shouldn't be crying
Tears were for the weaker days
I'm stronger now, or so I say
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream
I just can't figure it out
I guess I'll just wait it out 
I found the one
He changed my life
But was it me that changed
And he just happened to come at the right time
I'm supposed to be in love, but I'm numb again
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
It's just sitting there laughing at me
And I just wanna scream
I just can't figure it out
I guess I'll just wait it out 
What now? 
There's no one to call, 'cause I'm just playing games with them all
But the more I swear I'm happy, the more that I'm feeling alone
'Cause I spend every hour just going through the motions
I can't even get the emotions to come out
Dry as a bone, but I just wanna shout
I just can't figure it out
I guess I'll just wait it out 
What now? 
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know, oh-oh, why
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry

It's an addiction such an eruption
Sound is my remedy feeding me energy
Music is all I need
Baby, I just wanna dance
I don't really care I just wanna dance
I don't really care… care… care She's been a crazy dita disco diva… and you wonder:"
Too cold for you to keep her
Too hot for you to leave her
Back on the dancefloor better not to take me home
Bass kicking so hot blazing through my beating heart
French kissing on the floor, heart is beating hardcore
Heard everybody is getting a little sexy on the crazy juice
This will end up in the news
Baby, I just wanna dance

I don't know if you could take it
Know you wanna see me nakey, nakey, naked
I wanna be your baby, baby, baby
Spinnin' and it's wet just like it came from Maytag
White girl wasted on that brown liquor
When I get like this, I can't be around you
I'm too lit to dim down a notch
'Cause I could name some things that I'm gon' do
Wild, wild, wild thoughts
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts
I hope you know I'm for the takin' 
You know this cookie's for the bakin'
Kitty, kitty, baby, give that thing some rest 
'Cause you done beat it like the '68 Jets 
Diamonds ain't nothin' when I'm rockin' with ya
Diamonds ain't nothin' when I'm shinin' with ya
Just keep it white and black as if I'm your sister
I'm too hip to hop around town out here with ya
I know I get wild, wild, wild
Wild, wild, wild thoughts
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts
Ayy, I heard that pussy for the takin'
I heard it got these other niggas goin' crazy
Yeah, I'll treat you like a lady, lady 
Fuck you 'til you burned out, cremation 
Make it cream, yeah, Wu-Tang 
Throw that ass back, bouquet 
Call me and I can get it juicy
I can tell you're gone off the D'USSÉ 
Careful, mama, watch what you say 
You talkin' to me like your new bae 
Girl, you talkin' like you tryna do things
Now that pipe got her runnin' like she Usain, baby
You made me drown in it, ooh, touché, baby
I'm carrying that water, Bobby Boucher, baby
And you know I'ma slaughter like I'm Jason
Bust it, why you got it on safety?
White girl wasted on brown liquor 
I probably shouldn't be around you 
'Cause you get wild, wild, wild 
You lookin' like there's nothin' that you won't do 
Ayy, girl, that's when I told you 
When I'm with you, all I get is wild thoughts

Ice ya chest you make me feel like I'm climbin' on Mount Everest
Hey Rihanna, your lovin' really put me to the test
But if you should request mi soul
The answer would be yes
Yes to this yes, yes to that, yes to whateva you suggest
So please say yes 
Haters gonna hate 
I found out much too late
I think I know we're a little hot now 
The truth comes to the light
The heart ain't always right 
And I see that love is blind now 
Boy, you used to have my trust
But without trust, there ain't no us, boy
No, no, no 
You don't love me  and I know now
No, no, no 
You don't love me, so let me go now
If you ask me , baby , I should've left you  a long time ago, no
Mi can't let you go
So please say yes
No, no, no 
You don't love me 
And I know  now 
No, no, no

And the saints we see are all made of gold
When your dreams all fail and the ones we hail
Are the worst of all, and the blood's run stale
I wanna hide the truth, I wanna shelter you
But with the beast inside, there's nowhere we can hide
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
At the curtain's call it's the last of all
When the lights fade out, all the sinners crawl
So they dug your grave and the masquerade
Will come calling out at the mess you've made
Don't wanna let you down, but I am hell-bound
Though this is all for you, don't wanna hide the truth
No matter what we breed, we still are made of greed
This is my kingdom come, this is my kingdom come
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes

Don't get too close; it's dark inside
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
They say it's what you make, I say it's up to fate
It's woven in my soul, I need to let you go
Your eyes, they shine so bright, I wanna save that light
I can't escape this now, unless you show me how
When you feel my heat, look into my eyes
It's where my demons hide, it's where my demons hide
Don't get too close; it's dark inside

For my mind to run around, with my ear up to the ground
I'm searchin' to behold the stories that are told
When my back is to the world that was smilin' when I turned
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y
My enemy-y-y-y-y 
Your words up on thе wall as you're prayin' for my fall
And the laughter in thе halls and the names that I've been called
I stack it in my mind, and I'm waitin' for the time
When I show you what it's like to be words spit in a mic
Tell you you're the greatest
But once you turn, they hate us 
Everybody wants to be my enemy
Everybody wants to be my enemy-y-y-y-y 
My enemy-y-y-y-y 
I'm hopin' that somebody pray for me
I'm prayin' that somebody hope for me
I'm stayin' where nobody 'posed to be p-p-posted
Being a wreck of emotions
Ready to go whenever, just let me know
The road is long, so put the pedal into the floor
The enemy on my trail, my energy unavailable
I'ma tell 'em, "Hasta luego"
They wanna plot on my trot to the top
I been outta shape, thinkin' out the box, I'm an astronaut
I blasted off the planet rock to cause catastrophe
And it matters more because I had it not
Had I thought about wreaking havoc
On an opposition, kinda shockin' they wanted static
With precision, I'm automatic quarterback
I ain't talkin' sackin', pack it
Pack it up, I don't panic, batter-batter up
Who the baddest? It don't matter 'cause we at your throat

Everybody wants to be my enemy

It's time to begin, isn't it?
I get a little bit bigger, but then I'll admit
I'm just the same as I was
Now don't you understand?
That I'm never changing who I am

Ever since I could remember
Everything inside of me
Just wanted to fit in 
I was never one for pretenders
Everything I tried to be
Just wouldn't settle in 
If I told you what I was
Would you turn your back on me?
And if I seemed dangerous
Would you be scared?
I get the feeling just because
Everything I touch isn't dark enough
That this problem lies in me
I'm only a man with a candle to guide me
I'm taking a stand to escape what's inside me
A monster, a monster
I've turned into a monster
A monster, a monster
And it keeps getting stronger
Can I clear my conscience
If I'm different from the rest?
Do I have to run and hide? 
I never said that I want this
This burden came to me
And it's made its home inside 
If I told you what I was
Would you turn your back on me?
And if I seemed dangerous
Would you be scared?
I get the feeling just because
Everything I touch isn't dark enough
That this problem lies in me

As a child, you would wait and watch from far away
But you always knew that you'd be the one
That work while they all play
In youth, you'd lay awake at night and scheme
Of all the things that you would change
But it was just a dream
Here we are, don't turn away now

Falling too fast to prepare for this
Tripping in the world could be dangerous
Everybody circling is vulturous
Everybody waiting for the fall of man
Everybody praying for the end of times
Everybody hoping they could be the one
I was born to run, I was born for this
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes
Always had a fear of being typical
Looking at my body feeling miserable
Always hanging on to the visual
I wanna be invisible
Looking at my years like a martyrdom
Everybody needs to be a part of 'em
Never be enough, I'm the prodigal son
I was born to run, I was born for this
Run me like a racehorse
Pull me like a ripcord
Break me down and build me up
I wanna be the slip, slip
Word upon your lip, lip
Letter that you rip, rip
Break me down and build me up
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes
Don't wanna be the parenthetical, hypothetical
Working hard on something that I'm proud of, out of the box
An epoxy to the world and the vision we've lost
I'm just a symbol to remind you that there's more to see
I'm just a product of the system, a catastrophe
And yet a masterpiece, and yet I'm half-diseased
And when I am deceased
At least I'll go down to the grave and die happily
And leave the body and the soul to be a part of thee
I do what it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do whatever it takes
'Cause I love how it feels when I break the chains
Yeah, take me to the top
I'm ready for whatever it takes
'Cause I love the adrenaline in my veins
I do what it takes

Up in the morning
Up in the evening
When the birds come back to eat
Up on the mountain
Down in the king's lair
In the heat of the afternoon
We were never welcome here
We were never welcome here at all
It's who we are
Doesn't matter if we've gone too far
Doesn't matter if it's all okay
Doesn't matter if it's not our day
Oh, won't you save us
'Cause it's all uphill from here
Up in the attic
Down in the cellar
Lost in the static
Coming back for more
Out with the reason
In with the season
In my book of jealousy
We were never welcome here
We were never welcome here at all
It's who we are
Doesn't matter if we've gone too far
Doesn't matter if it's all okay
Doesn't matter if it's not our day
Because it's who we are
Doesn't matter if we've gone too far
Doesn't matter if it's all okay

Days pass by, and my eyes, they dry, and I think that I'm okay
'Til I find myself in conversation, fading away
The way you smile, the way you walk
The time you took to teach me all that you had taught
Tell me, how am I supposed to move on?
These days I'm becoming everything that I hate
Wishing you were around, but now it's too late
My mind is a place that I can't escape your ghost
Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away
One more rainy day without you
Sometimes I wish that I could see you one more day
One more rainy day
Oh, I'm a wreck without you here
Yeah, I'm a wreck since you've been gone
I've tried to put this all behind me
I think I was wrecked all along
Yeah, I'm a wreck
They say that the time will heal it, the pain will go away
But everything, it reminds me of you and it comes in waves
The way you laugh when your shoulders shook
The time you took to teach me all that you had taught
Tell me, how am I supposed to move on?
These days I'm becoming everything that I hate
Wishing you were around, but now it's too late
My mind is a place that I can't escape your ghost
Sometimes I wish that I could wish it all away

These days when I'm on the brink of the edge
I remember the words that you said
Remember the life you led
You'd say, "Oh, suck it all up, don't get stuck in the mud
Thinking of things that you should have done"
I'll see you again, my loved one
Yeah, I'm a wreck
I'll see you again, my loved one
Yeah, I'm a wreck without you here
Yeah, I'm a wreck since you've been gone

I find it hard to say the things I want to say the most
Find a little bit of steady as I get close
Find a balance in the middle of the chaos
Send me low, send me high, send me never demigod
I remember walking in the cold of November
Hoping that I make it to the end of December
27 years and the end on my mind
But holding to the thought of another time
But looking to the ways of the ones before me
Looking for the path of the young and lonely
I don't wanna hear about what to do
I don’t wanna do it just to do it for you
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel
Like I’m empty and there's nothing really real, real
I'm looking for a way out
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to never feel, feel
Like I'm good enough for anything that's real, real
I'm looking for a way out
I find it hard to tell you how I wanna run away
I understand it always makes you feel a certain way
I find a balance in the middle of the chaos
Send me up, send me down, send me ’nother demigod
I remember walking in the heat of the summer
Wide-eyed one with a mind full of wonder
27 years and I’ve nothing to show
Falling from the dove to the dark of the crow
Looking to the ways of the ones before me
Looking for the path of the young and lonely
I don't wanna hear about what to do, no
I don’t wanna do it just to do it for you
Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero
Let me show you what it's like to always feel, feel

Let me tell you what it's like to be a zero, zero

Let me tell you 'bout it, well let me tell you 'bout it

Hace mucho tiempo que quiero decirte algo y no puedo
Se me pone la piel de gallina cada vez que te veo
Ya busqué en internet pa' ver si es normal
Sentirse tan bien y a la vez tan mal
Quererte besar sin poder besarte
Tocar sin poder tocarte
No tengo fotos contigo, pero en la pared tengo un espacio
No hemos salido ni un día y ya quiero cеlebrar aniversario
Quiero quе esta noche vengas de visita
De fondo poner tu playlist favorita
Quiero hacerlo contigo, yo no quiero tener que ir despacio
Yo sé que piensas en mí
Y el corazón se te mueve
Si tú quieres ir a mil
Yo estoy en novecientos noventa y nueve
Yo sé que piensas en mí 
Y el corazón se te mueve 
Si tú quieres ir a mil
Yo estoy en novecientos noventa y nueve
Yo sé que pa' llegar a mil hay que empezar de cero
Primero cae la lluvia ante' del aguacero
Y pa' serte sincero, yo ya no me espero
No tengo duda' que esto es amor verdadero, mmm
Llevo ya rato pensando en la noche perfecta
Cuando ya pueda tenerte completa
Tú y yo volando sin avioneta
No tengo fotos contigo, pero en la pared tengo un espacio 
No hemos salido ni un día y ya quiero celebrar aniversario 
Quiero que esta noche vengas de visita 
De fondo poner tu playlist favorita
Quiero hacerlo contigo, yo no quiero tener que ir despacio 
Yo sé que piensas en mí
Y el corazón se te mueve 
Si tú quieres ir a mil
Yo estoy en novecientos noventa y nueve 
Yo sé que piensas en mí
Y el corazón se te mueve 
Si tú quieres ir a mil
Yo estoy en novecientos noventa y nueve 
Tengo gana' ya de hacer contigo 
Lo que hicimo' ya en mi cabeza
No son los primeros, pero sí que sean los mío'
Los último' labios que besas
No tengo fotos contigo, pero en la pared tengo un espacio
No hemos salido ni un día y ya quiero celebrar aniversario
Quiero que esta noche vengas de visita

My friends, they wanna take me to the movies
I tell 'em to fuck off, I'm holding hands with my depression
And right when I think I've overcome it
Anxiety starts kicking in to teach that shit a lesson
Oh, I try my best just to be social
I make all these plans with friends and hope they call and cancel
Then I overthink about the things I’m missing
Now I'm wishing I was with 'em
Feel like I'm always apologizing for feeling
Like I'm out of my mind when I'm doing just fine
And my exes'll say that I'm hard to deal with
And I admit it, yeah
But all my friends, they don't know what it's like, what it's like
They don't understand why I can't sleep through the night
I've been told that I could take something to fix it
Damn, I wish it, I wish it was that simple, ah
All my friends they don't know what it's like, what it's like
Always wanted to be one of those people in the room
That says something and everyone puts their hand up
Like, "If you're sad, put your hand up
If you hate someone, put your hand up
If you're scared, put your hand up"
Feel like I'm always apologizing for feeling
Like I'm out of my mind when I'm doing just fine
And my exes will say that I'm hard to deal with

And I thought that I could take something to fix it
Damn, I wish it, I wish it was that simple, ah
All my friends they don't know what it's like, what it's like
I got all these thoughts, running through my mind
All the damn time and I can't seem to shut it off
I think I'm doing fine most of the time
I think that I'm alright, but I can't seem to shut it off
I got all these thoughts, running through my mind
All the damn time and I can't seem to shut it off
I think I'm doing fine most of the time
I say that I'm alright, but I can't seem to shut it off
Shut it, shut it, yeah

Thought that I could chase you with the cold evenin'
Let a couple years water down how I’m feelin' about you 
And every time we talk
Every single word builds up to this moment
And I gotta convince myself I don’t want it even though I do 
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it
If I could do it all again, I know I’d go back to you
I know I’d go back to you, oh
I know I'd go back to you
We never got it right
Playin’ and replayin' old conversations
Overthinkin' every word and I hate it
'Cause it’s not me 
And what's the point in hidin'?
Everybody knows, we got unfinished business
And I'll regret it if I didn't say
This isn't what it could be 
You could break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true 
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to
When I'm lyin' close to someone else
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it 
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
I'd go back to you
I know I said I wasn't sure
But I'd go back to you
I know I'd go back to you
You can break my heart in two
But when it heals, it beats for you
I know it's forward, but it's true
Won't lie, I'd go back to you
You know, my thoughts are runnin' loose
It's just a thing you make me do
And I could fight, but what's the use?
I know I'd go back to you
I wanna hold you when I'm not supposed to 
When I'm lyin' close to someone else 
You're stuck in my head and I can't get you out of it 
If I could do it all again, I know I'd go back to you

But then I see your face
Oh, wait, that's someone else
Tryna play it coy
Tryna make it disappear
But just like the battle of Troy
There's nothing subtle here
In my room, there's a king-size space
Bigger than it used to be
If you want, you can rent that place
Call me an amenity
Even if it's in my dreams
Ooh, you're taking up a fraction of my mind
Ooh, every time I watch you serpentine

I see how your attention builds
It's like looking in a mirror
Your touch like a happy pill
But still all we do is fear, oh-oh
What could possibly happen next?
Can we focus on the love?
Paint my kiss across your chest
If you're the art, I'll be the brush

Pero ahora este pecho es antibalas
No te tengo a ti, me tengo a mí
No es para que piense' que esto es pa' ti, nah
Yo me fui para que no se te olvide
De a una muerte como tú sе revive
Cuando se sеque el último mar
Es cuando pensaré en regresar
Está sobreentendido lo que siento
Ya no estás, qué bueno es el tiempo
Estoy curá' de ti, te dije ya
Ya no te siento aquí, no te siento ya
Nunca supiste, no me supiste valorar, y— 
De una vez por toda' , ah-ah-ah
Soy más fuerte sola, ah-ah-ah-ah
Y es que no me arrepiento del pasado
Sé que el tiempo a tu lado cortó mis alas 
Pero ahora este pecho es antibalas
Ahora este pecho es antibalas
Ahora este pecho es antibalas

>>>Feel Me Selena Gomez
<sos>
No one love you like I love ya
Never cheat, never lie
Never put no one above ya
I gave you space and time
Now you're telling me you miss it
And I'm still on your mind
We were one in a million
And love is hard to find
Do you stay up late
Just so you don't dream?
Every time your lips touch another
I want you to feel me
Every time you dance with somebody
I want you to feel me
Do your days get a little bit longer?
Nights get a little bit colder?
Heart beat a little bit louder?
Oh 
Days get a little bit longer? 
Nights get a little bit colder? 
Heart beat a little bit louder?
When you're running, who you run to?
Where do you go to hide?
When she ain't giving you enough to
Get you through the night
Won't be caught up in the middle
Of your highs and your lows
Baby, long as you're not with me
You'll always be alone
Do you stay up late
Just so you don't dream?
Every time your lips touch another
I want you to feel me
Every time you dance with somebody
I want you to feel me
Do your days get a little bit longer?
Nights get a little bit colder?
Heart beat a little bit louder?
Oh 
Days get a little bit longer? 
Nights get a little bit colder? 
Heart beat a little bit louder?
Do you feel me? 
Feel me 
Feel me 
Every time your lips touch another
I want you to feel me
Every time you dance with somebody
I want you to feel me
Do your days get a little bit longer?
Nights get a little bit colder?
Heart beat a little bit louder?
Oh 
Days get a little bit longer? 
Nights get a little bit colder? 
Heart beat a little bit louder?
Every time your lips touch another
Every time you dance with somebody

Take it or leave it
Baby take it or leave it
But I know you won't leave it
'Cause I know that you need it
Look in the mirror
When I look in the mirror
Baby I see it clearer
Why you wanna be nearer
You got a fetish for my love
I push you out and you come right back
Don't see a point in blaming you
If I were you, I'd do me too
You got a fetish for my love
I push you out and you come right back
Don't see a point in blaming you
If I were you, I'd do me too
You got a fetish for my love

Going over your limit
But I know you can't quit it
Got you hooked on my body
Take you over and under and twisted up like origami
You got a fetish for my love

Don't see a point in blaming you

I blame you 'cause it's all your fault
You're playin' hard, don't turn me off
You actin' hard, but I know you soft
You my fetish, I'm so with it
All these rumors bein' spreaded
Might as well go 'head and whip it
'Cause they sayin' we already did it
Call on Gucci if you ever need me
I'll be South Beach in the drop top gleamin'
Just need you in a blue bikini
You got a fetish for my love
I push you out and you come right back
Don't see a point in blaming you
If I were you, I'd do me too

I'm on my 14 carats
Doing it up like Midas
Now you say I got a touch
So good, so good
Make you never wanna leave
So don't, so don't
Gonna wear that dress you like, skin-tight
Do my hair up real, real nice
And syncopate my skin to your heart beating
Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you
I just wanna look good for you, good for you
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you
I'm on my marquise diamonds

Could even make that Tiffany jealous
You say I give it to you hard
So bad, so bad

Trust me, I, trust me, I, trust me, I
Hold on, take a minute, love
Cause I ain't trying to fuck your image up
Like we mess around in triple cuffs
Stumble 'round town, pull your zipper up
Pants sag like I don't give a
I ain't trying to fuck your business up
And I ain't trying to get you into stuff
But the way you touchin' on me in the club
Rubbin' on my miniature
John Hancock, fuck the signature
Any time I hit it, know she finna fall through
And every time we get up, always end up on the news
Ain't worried bout no press and ain't worried bout the next bitch
They love the way you dress and ain't got shit up on you
Jackpot, hit the jackpot
Just met a bad bitch without the ass shots
You look good, girl, you know you did good, don't you?
You look good, girl, bet it feel good, don't it?
Cause I just wanna look good for you, good for you
Baby, let me be good to you, good to you
Let me show you how proud I am to be yours
Leave this dress a mess on the floor
And still look good for you, good for you
Trust me, I, trust me, I, trust me, I

What the heart wants
What the heart wants 
You got me sipping on something
I can't compare to nothing I've ever known
I'm hoping that after this fever I'll survive
I know I'm acting a bit crazy
Strung out, a little bit hazy
Hand over heart, I'm praying
That I'm gonna make it out alive
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
You got me scattered in pieces
Shining like stars and screaming
Lighting me up like Venus
But then you disappear and make me wait
And every second's like torture
Heroin drip, no more so
Finding a way to let go
Baby, baby, no, I can't escape
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
This is a modern fairytale
No happy endings, no wind in our sails
But I can't imagine a life without
Breaking me down, down, down, down
The bed's getting cold and you're not here
The future that we hold is so unclear
But I'm not alive until you call
And I'll bet the odds against it all
Save your advice, 'cause I won't hear
You might be right, but I don't care
There's a million reasons why I should give you up
But the heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants
The heart wants what it wants, baby

Wanna hear a part to my story? I tried to hide in the glory
And sweep it under the table so you would never know
Sometimes I feel like an accident, people look when they're passin' it
Never check on the passenger, they just want the free show
Tryna fight somethin' that my eyes can't see
My mind and me
We don't get along sometimes
And it gets hard to breathe
But I wouldn't change my life
And all of the crashin' and burnin' and breakin', I know now
If somеbody sees me like this, then thеy won't feel alone now
My mind and me
It's hard to talk and feel heard when you always feel like a burden
Don't wanna add to concern I know they already got
But if I pull back the curtain, then maybe someone who's hurtin'
Will be a little more certain they're not the only one lost
Tryna fight somethin' that my eyes can't see
My mind and me
We don't get along sometimes
And it gets hard to breathe
But I wouldn't change my life
And all of the crashin' and burnin' and breakin', I know now

And I wonder what's mine
Can't take no more
Wonder if you'll understand
It's just the touch of your hand
Behind a closed door
And all I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you 
All I needed was the love you gave
All I needed for another day
And all I ever knew
Only you 
I'm trying to be honest with my happiness
Don't know why I'm bad at this, uh
And I don't wanna sit in all my sadness
I know it's a habit of mine
I start what I don't know how to end
Don't re-, don't remind me
I ruined it before it began, oh
Last night was the last night of my past life
Got me here like you could never figure me out
Last night was the last time, was the last time
I never let you figure me out
Sitting here, talking to myself
Thinking how I used to use you, only thing I'm used to
Last night was the last time, was the last time, woah
Gave me what I wanted when I needed it
Honestly, I mean it
And if I could convince myself to feel it
You know I would feel it, I would
I start what I don't know how to end
Don't re-, don't remind me
I ruined it before it began, oh
Last night was the last night of my past life
Got me here like you could never figure me out
Last night was the last time, was the last time
I'll never let you figure me out
Sitting here, talking to myself
Thinking how I used to use you, only thing I'm used to
Last night was the last night of my past life, woah
Oh, woah, woah, woah
Last night was the last night of my past life
Got me here like you could never figure me out
Last night was the last time, was the last time
I never let you figure me out
Sitting here, talking to myself
Thinking how I used to use you, only thing I'm used to
Last night was the last night of my past life, woah
Oh, woah, woah, woah
 Where we've been
What we know 
Will never go away 
Will never go away 
Will never go away
Will never go away

Up in the clouds
Yeah, you know how to make me want you
When we come down
Oh I know, yeah I know, it's over
You don't know how to love me when you're sober
When the bottle's done you pull me closer
And you're saying all the things that you're supposed to
But you don't know how to love me when you're sober
Why is it so different when we wake up?
Same lips, same kiss, but not the same touch
Don't you know that you do it just enough, but not enough
But I know what's next, and I want so much
Up in the clouds
Yeah, you know how to make me want you
When we come down

Now I can't get you outta my brain
Oh, it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do
I just hope you're lyin' next to somebody
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then, I think you
Might want me to come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong
If you're lookin' into her eyes
If she's holdin' onto you so tight
The way I did before
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you outta my brain
Ooh, it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do
Like we used to do
What kinda dress you're wearin' tonight
If he's givin' it to you just right
The way I did before
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you outta my brain
Oh, it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do

In your eyes, there's a heavy blue
One to love, and one to lose
Sweet divine, a heavy truth
Water or wine, don't make me choose
I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night, night
Drunk on a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky
I've been running through the jungle
I've been running with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you
I've been down the darkest alleys
Saw the dark side of the moon
To get to you, to get to you
I've looked for love in every stranger
Took too much to ease the anger
All for you, yeah, all for you
I've been running through the jungle
I've been crying with the wolves
To get to you, to get to you, to get to you
To get to you
Your fingertips trace my skin
To places I have never been
Blindly, I am following
Break down these walls and come on in
I wanna feel the way that we did that summer night, night
Drunk on a feeling, alone with the stars in the sky

This man's kinda high out here *Laughs*
Ayo, the flyest ma'fucker in the room, yeah, you know it's me
Bitches hatin' on him 'cause he started out here locally
Hopefully, I'll be at the top soon
For now, I'm at my house on the couch watchin' cartoons
You know how much you love it when you get it in abundance
Give a fuck about a budget when you always be the subject of discussion
But it's nothin' when you stop and just say, "fuck it"
'Cause you walkin' out in public and you hear 'em talkin' rubbish
I just wanna ride, ride through the city in a Cutlass
Find a big butt bitch somewhere, get my nuts kissed
That's the way it goes when you party just like I do
Bitches on my dick that used to brush me off in high school
Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit?
Take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit? 
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
That's why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have
And they in awe, we gon' win, you can take the lose or draw
What I'm in got these hoes who used to play me in they bras
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
Take over the world, watch these haters get mad
That's why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have
Hop into the car and then we take 'em to the pad, it's a wrap
And ma'fuckers think they know me, but they never met the kid
Style come with excellence and money make benevolence
Irrelevant for the fuckers who never been intelligent
I kill my Henny, break the bottle for the hell of it
Tell a bitch that she better bring her friends
And if she want an autograph she better bring a pen
Yeah, the party never end, this life is what I recommend
And if you got a ho picked for me, then she better be a 10
I ain't picky, but these girls be actin' tricky
When the situation's sticky and the liquor got 'em silly
But I take over the world when I'm on my Donald Trump shit
Look at all this money! Ain't that some shit?
We gon' take over the world while these haters gettin' mad
That's why all my bitches bad, they see this crazy life I have
And they in awe, we gon' win, you can take the lose or draw

And I ain't no hipster, but girl, I can make your hips stir
From Pittsburgh, smoke papers or a swisher
Welcome  to the Cam Rellim chronicles
Lookin' out my monocle
I'm dodgin' obstacles, I gamble like the Bellagio
You cock-a-roach, I'm heroin 'cause everything I talk is dope
Type to leave it clean and fuckin' shiny, word to Mop & Glo
Tryin' to get a mansion, ain’t nobody here gon' find my room
Money gon' be green, I guarantee you that my slide stay blue
So press play, I start from scratch and never use no template
The next day, these losers always goin' with what's trendy
My pen game is somethin' these motherfuckers have never seen
All City Champion, everybody is second-string
No need to testify  for the best is I 
And anybody in my way gon' be left to die
I'ma feed the world, you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs go numb, I don't plan on lookin' back 
Anything you need, you can find it at the market
If you don’t hold me down, for all I care, you can starve, bitch
I'ma feed the world, you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs go numb, I don't plan on lookin' back 
Anything you need, you can find it at the market
I got my own stickers now, so literally I’m everywhere
Hundred different shoes, still feel the need to cop a fresher pair
These motherfuckers treat me like it’s just my second year
Fool, you better get prepared
Don't know 'bout you but all my rhymes is deadly here
Frick Park Market, where we kickin' out the garbage
Sick bars, I’ve been a boss, so stick around and watch it
Didn't fit around no college campus, chillin', writin' on top of planet Earth
Fuck who's first, It’s just 'bout who the hardest
On my own, too, fuck who's sayin' different
Every time I rhyme, I get that Punxsutawney feelin'
I’m the starter, you a fill-in
You a martyr, I’m just killin'
Gettin' harder with each time I write
Wish I could rewind last night
I had so much fun just kickin' it and goin' in
Don’t call me Malcolm if you didn't fuckin' know me then
And if you lonely, girl, I could be your only friend
You got some shit to say? I suggest you hold it in, bitch
I'ma feed the world, you can put it on my tab
Run until my legs go numb, I don't plan on lookin' back 
Anything you need, you can find it at the market
If you don't hold me down, for all I care, you can starve, bitch

I spent the whole day in my head
Do a little spring cleanin'
I'm always too busy dreamin'
Well, maybe I should wake up instead
A lot of things I regret, but I just say I forget
Why can't it just be easy?
Why does everybody need me to stay?
Oh, I hate the feelin'
When you're high, but you're underneath the ceilin'
Got the cards in my hand, I hate dealin', yeah
Get everything I need, then I'm gone, but it ain't stealin'
Can I get a break?
I wish that I could just get out my goddamn way
What is there to say?
There ain't a better time than today
Well, maybe I'll lay down for a little, yeah
Instead of always tryin' to figure everything out
And all I do is say sorry
Half the time I don't even know what I'm sayin' it about
Good news, good news, good news
That's all they wanna hear
No, they don't like it when I'm down
But when I'm flyin', oh
It make 'em so uncomfortable
So different, what's the difference?
When it ain't that bad
It could always be worse
I'm runnin' out of gas, hardly anything left
Hope I make it home from work
Well, so tired of bein' so tired
Why I gotta build somethin' beautiful just to go set it on fire?
I'm no liar, but
Sometimes the truth don't sound like the truth
Maybe 'cause it ain't
I just love the way it sound when I say it, yeah
It's what I do
If you know me, it ain't anything new
Wake up to the moon, haven't seen the sun in a while
But I heard that the sky's still blue, yeah
I heard they don't talk about me too much no more
And that's the problem with a closed door
Good news, good news, good news
That's all they wanna hear
No, they don't like it when I'm down
But when I'm flyin', oh
It make 'em so uncomfortable
So different, what's the difference?
There's a whole lot more for me waitin' on the other side
I'm always wonderin' if it feel like summer
I know maybe I'm too late, I could make it there some other time
That there's a whole lot more for me waitin'
I know maybe I'm too late, I could make it there some other time
Then I'll finally discover
That it ain't that bad, ain't so bad
Well, it ain't that bad, mm
At least it don't gotta be no more
No more, no more, no more, no more
Mm, hey, mm, mm, mm

There's a party on Fifth Ave. tonight
And that's what I'm tryin' to do
What's goin' on? There's a party
Hope the neighbors don't mind us gettin' loud
Homies to the left, all the ladies to the right
We came to get down, we gon' do that now
My light up shoes on, my light up shoes on, my light up shoes on
They love the way my kicks flash
This ain't a time to just sit back
'Cause there's a party on Fifth Ave
There's a party on Fifth Ave. 
Hit me if you tryna go 
I can be there in like twenty, I'ma honk it and come runnin'
'Cause we gotta hit the road 
Make you sure you got a clean shirt, clean pants, new shoes 
Or just hitch a ride there, you choose 
There's a party on Fifth Ave. tonight
And that's what I'm tryin' to do

Close my eyes before I cross the street
Car 'bout to hit me, then he oughta beep 
Watchin' Dawson's Creek 'til I fall asleep
It's harder than it seems, I'm underwater in my dreams
I'm in awe, this jigsaw puzzle's not complete
I'm just an idea, nothin' con-cer-ete 
Came to raise limits, get higher than plane engines
They tryna change wit' us, but come to the same difference 
Shut your pie-hole, I'm dope and I know
My voice sound like it was a sample off a vinyl
I don't mind those hatin' on my style
I tend to take the high road, get stoned and fly low
I don't think that I'm a human though, 'cause I'm so odd
People sellin' drugs 'cause they can't find no job
Wonder if Christ made a million off of sellin' the cross
Let bygones be bygones, my mind strong as pythons
The day that I die on will turn me to an icon
Search the world for Zion or a shoulder I can cry on
The best of all time, I'm Dylan, Dylan, Dylan
 Somebody do somethin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah, somebody move somethin'

Sippin' Jameson like I was majored in whiskey flavorin'
When I'm drunk, I'll cut your head off and leave it danglin' 
FlyLo's still tryna put me onto Ableton
Asian women love me, I look like David Duchovny
In kindergarten, used to put some condoms in my cubby
In case one of these hoes was tryna fuck me
I ain't nobody, and neither are you 
Been contemplatin' if I even still believe in the truth, I'm so stubborn
I'd rather write my own history book
Where the world don't give a fuck 'bout how you physically look
All your songs are sixteens and a hook
We here to reinvent music, it's time for the revolution
I'm dyin' for the movement, tryin' not to lose it
Jewish Buddhist consumin' the views of Christianity
Wonder if Hindus like to eat fish soup
If it's true, they should hit Alaska in a igloo
I hear the fish bitin' nice right now
I can't figure out life and feel right right now
Boo, if I think it, I should say it, there's a reason that I write it down
Spit the shit that leave a diaper brown 
Uh, yeah  somebody do somethin'
Yeah, yeah, yeah

They told me, "Don't make a promise you can't keep
All the drugs in your system, you can't sleep
How many times you had to buy a Plan B
For a girl you never bring back home to meet your family?", man
Man, I swear it's what I dream about
Ever since my mom told me that she need me out
Always smokin' weed, causin' trouble, never clean the house
But I paid her back for everything; I guess we even now
Nothin' better than some head after a long day
That's the only thing that ever keep mine on straight
And she asked me, "Why the long face?"
How I spent three-hundred-fifty dollars on this entrée?
I drown my sorrow in that bottle
Today is full of regret, find forever in tomorrow
Man up, what's the problem?
Everything is Jazz and I'm Stockton 
I know it seem a little bit strange sometimes
Everybody live a little, everybody die
Baby, I would spend it all witchu
Yeah, and I'm headed to the
Other side, where the grass is always greener
And your bitch is down to ride, but that ass is always meaner
See, my cash got deeper and my morals disappeared
Never thought I'd be a asshole, this my last show
Can I please get a standin' ovation?
A hunnid naked bitches in my dressin' room waitin'
We lost a lot of blood for this fucked up nation
But me, I'm gettin' high, makin' love in that spaceship
So what are the basics? Tell me your problems
You losin' your job or, even worse, you don't got one
So hard to stay sober when you feelin' fucked over so much
Always comin' up short, you like the roach of a blunt, yeah
And I could never sleep at night
Fuck payin' bills, I need a brand new lease on life
Why does doin' wrong always feel so right?
Well, I guess, fuck it, that's life
I know it seem a little bit strange sometimes
Everybody live a little, everybody die
Baby, I would spend it all witchu
Now, I wish I could take all your pain
But when the toxin is fame
The drugs, they don't fill the hole, no
Wish you'd picked up the phone
Knew that I'd be your home, knew that you weren't alone
Knew that you weren't alone, knew that you weren't alone
I saw you act a little bit strange sometimes
"Yeah, everybody lives and everybody dies
You could have spent it on the truth
